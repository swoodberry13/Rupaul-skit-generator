do need you to give me one name out of the three i would say chanel okay and why is that she's a little annoying you know at times thank you all right nina who should be eliminated tonight rebecca why because america's next drag queen superstar should be someone with experience so that this person can take the title with dignity and respect all right bibi same question i would say rebecca because working with her is frustrating and real when it comes down to it amongst all of us i know rebecca is at a lower level that's what i have to say thank you baby chanel who should be eliminated tonight i'm so glad you asked me this question i nominate myself because i don't want to be here anymore since day one i have been judged really hard and i'm very frustrated that you can't see the personality because i am so real you have no idea and i don't feel that i am being understood here i am beautiful i'm a beautiful person internally and on the outside and it's so so frustrating to me that that image does not seem to be conveyed week after week when we come into an elimination around i am so negatively critiqued the truth is you are beautiful you are really beautiful thank you no thank you you are you are that sounds so nice to hear it's true and i i i'm sorry i i i thought i told you earlier i really did i would not like you to leave you are a great contender for this contest in answer to your question i nominate myself thank you chanel i'm gonna have to send someone home who should it be and why the weakest person in the group you know is tatiana tatiana who do you think should go home today i'm just gonna go with morgan because she has immunity tatiana that's an answer for the miss america contest not the rupaul drag race contest nicole same question send them all home send all these home okay and all these i mean they eventually all have to go so i mean i don't want to be the one to go so send them all raven who would you send home tonight i would say tatiana i don't think she wants to be like a grand superstar diva i think she's comfortable being a beautiful girl no not the case if i was comfortable being a beautiful girl i was a beautiful girl at home that's not why i'm here to be like pretty okay thank you my just my opinion who should be going home tonight i think phoenix the leader has to take responsibility i kind of agree with manila phoenix phoenix based on the runway presentation i would say myself all right raja i just don't like the idea of the possibility of my friend leaving because delta and i um i was so excited to see my very good friend here with me in this process i hope that if she has to lip-sync for her life that she lip syncs for her mother's life amen clearly you can tell which genre of music everyone is and it just kind of gets lost as far as her look carmen same question i have to agree with raja because i feel that there's always a look issue you need to look the part if you're going to be a drag superstar genre sofia i would say carmen because sometimes she looks like she's on vacation changela i honestly feel it would be carmen carrera where look is definitely important you have to be able to perform alexis mateo i going to pick carmen carrera as well and i think she's just resting and pretty [Music] which one of these does not deserve to be in the top three let's start with sharon needles [Music] i'm going to say fifi o'hara she has a very cut throat attitude to be america's next drag superstar we need a sweetheart as drag queens i think we need to show as much heart and family morals amongst what you said right now is a complete lie i value family morals you're on stage lying is what you're doing i'm not lying but fifi o'hara same question i would definitely have to say sharon for him to stand on this stage and tell that i don't value family it's bullsh if i'm you know cut throat then so be it i'm a fierce competitor and i deserve to be here thank you fifi chad michaels same question i would say fifi she has a lot of maturing to do at times she has acted her age and she's made no qualms about wanting to win this contest hands down whatever it is that she needs to do latrice royale i feel sharon needles she has gotten through this competition being imperfect on the runway we strive for perfection if i were to come out here with unfinished seams and i ripped up this and ripped up that my ass would be handed to me i have one last question ggb which team should i send home this week and why i believe that jar alexis might be the one to go next i love you guys you know this i just find that sometimes you may place yourself in a box alexis same question less than home la trees and manila would you say they're your biggest competition biggest yeah latrice royale same question john x's because i can't understand a word they saying i'm just going to read everybody right here everybody thinks that we're in that competition just because we speak another language but we are all stars no matter where we come from and i'm going to tell you all something y'all better watch out we're working together to send all of you home said that who do you think deserves to go home tonight and why jinx monsoon vivian only because it seems like she's repeating the same notes that you guys are giving her ivy what about you uh i would have to say honey roxy vivian vivian i would say honey honey i would say vivian alyssa the one that i would want to send home is not in this lineup who's not in the lineup that you want to send home charisma uniqueness nerve and talent um i don't see jade at the same level he's kind of a little hokey pokey this is a drag queen competition which one of you should go home tonight and why let's start with dayla i think darien everyone else who's here has really shown an ability to hear critique and adjust and some folks like bianca just sail through but darien i think she frequently assumes she is doing better than people from an outside perspective might see all right thanks tayla adore delano i feel based on this challenge darian bianca del rio if it's about this particular challenge i would have to say darien and you know i'm not gonna lie to you i don't know which is why i'm called a and apparently i'm sailing now is that a bad thing whatever queen i should pick your ass just for being a that was like you're good at it yeah no that was very condescending [Music] darian lake same question i think darien you should really go home for what you have done today think about what you did and realize the criticisms who i think should go home whoever does not lip-sync for their life okay courtney act coming into this competition i earmarked adore as being top three and over the last few weeks she's kind of tripped and stumbled so i think that she would be the next to go but i guess based on tonight's comments i'm gonna say darian so your answer is adore and darius who deserves to go home tonight and why kennedy davenport i would have to say fame because clearly the struggle is real katya i would probably say fame because she's been in the bottom consistently over the past three or so weeks ginger minch i would have to agree and say fame i don't know how much more she has to offer trixie mattel fame she dropped the ball in her ugly look and her performance pearl i love her but you know i probably have to agree just based on not winning a challenge yet violet tchotchke you know trixie gets to come back in this competition and she should be looked at with a magnifying lens so i just feel like it should be tricksy all right miss fame i want to hear from you all these truth be told there's this part of pearls that's like too cool for season seven and that frustrates me because i'm fighting to stay and she knows what i'm talking about i don't know what she's talking about i don't think i'm too cool for season seven at all i'm actually really surprised to hear that from her who deserves to click their hills and go back to kansas starting with chi chi devayne i'm sorry derrick but your outfit to me was just a train wreck bob the drag queen based off this challenge i would pick derek as well naomi based on execution i would probably say derek's too derek well i would say all three that said me but i know i have to pick one i would say chi-chi's it's hot glued together it's cut fabric with no detail what say you robbie turner chi-chi's didn't scream dorothy to me kimchi i love her but i'm going to say chichi only because yesterday everyone's just working hard she was just sitting there and those are the times that she could have spent on her outfit sorry sergey thor you're up kimchi you literally said every word that i was gonna say i think in this competition you have to apply every single second and i'm here to win so people like chichi piss me off yes i did have extra time because i did hot glue my outfit but i did what was in my range of doing but that's how they feel so i respect y'all's opinion who deserves to go home tonight and why trinity taylor just from your critique that would be charlie peppermint same question based on the critiques charlie charlie height peppermint's look is a bit more basic so peppermint cynthia lee fontaine because i believe she's a strong competition for me and her total look peppermint all right eureka you're up i would say trinity i feel like the ending wrap up might have been a little more controlled if we worked as a group and i also felt like she was focused on herself and not really so much of everyone else i call shade i take responsibility for the things that i did wrong and if that's the reason why i should go home then i understand but don't tell me that i didn't do my job as a leader because i did and i included everybody including you eureka well i was asked my honest opinion and that's my honest opinion and i stand beside it all right nina trinity because she was a captain but she did her job it's just that we didn't we feel a part of it sometimes who deserves to go home tonight and why starting with eureka oh gosh honestly maybe asia o'hara because she's my biggest competition to be honest monet exchange um taking into account snatch game and tonight's assignment mermaid eleganza i would have to say the vixen fixing i have never seen such a level of unprofessionalism as i have watching eureka and it baffles me that you guys enjoy her so much it has really been very difficult working in an environment with her because she takes all the air out of the room she's always the one who get the last word in my defense i tell everyone all the time i'm sorry that i'm loud and i'm sorry i'm too much but you don't try to stop being loud or try to stop being too much you're like i'm sorry but this is who i am deal with this it's also a strength of mine when it comes to the confidence and acting but what i've seen from eureka is i'm the one who's getting all the attention in the room which to me is very childish which i guess is why the characters that she played has worked for her because she's a child i'm sorry that she feels that way but i will say one more thing again getting the last one i'm sorry but i can't let her sit there again and literally verbally attack me yes i do talk too much and i'm expressive and animated but i'm also extremely kind and i'm full of love because i know that sometimes i have a lot to deal with but i can't change that and i try i try to be understanding of people but i can't you weren't attacking me in front of people that i want to have respect for my art when i really have tried everything i can to be as kind as i can to vixen that's all i'll say i'm sorry all right thank you ladies all right asia because i'm an adult and although i've grown to love her and she's my sister i think the vixen has the most room for growth monique i love her so much but i would say the vixen um basing it solely on the challenge she had the weakest character out of them all and um she is kind of just plateaued and what say you acquire the vixen with the way she's interpreted some of the challenges who should go home tonight and why katrina michaels i think that all of these girls are strong so i'm going to say my biggest competitor should go home and that is aquaria you filthy yard i say send all the home you got the winner right here if i was gonna pick one i would go on critiques and as far as the worst i think it was miss cracker miss crumbs based on critique cracker and cameron are in the bottom i have a bias cameron should go home [Music] sabatina frankly rue i don't give a about your critiques but i wasn't obsessed with the looks tonight and i think this might be cameron's final hurrah in north korea i am not going to decorate it with pretty words and i'm also not going to send someone home because they're my competition if the is my competition let her stay here the person that i do not think is a star in this lineup is miss cracker or miss crumbs [Music] who should go home tonight [Music] and why starting with plastique tiara just based on the critiques my sister scarlett envy all right raja if it were my choice i would send scarlet a lot of the time when i was losing my way well well i won't blame her for some of the mistakes that i made but scarlet i would have to also say scarlet just based on what has happened nina west i would also say scarlet i will say this though nobody has worked harder so i think that should be noted scarlett who should go home tonight [Music] i can't say any of them but i'm not going to say me [Music] so who should go home i guess raj has been in the bottom a lot who should go home tonight and why start with evie oddly silky is the one girl who's gotten the same critiques a few times and hasn't ever polished out the things that you want to see from her scarlet envy well it came out in the work room today so silky knows i guess already nina west based on critique tonight i'm going to have to say evie oddly suga unfortunately silky just cause the critiques that you've given her you've given her before and today was an opportunity for her to really pay attention to those and execute and it didn't happen curia i'm going to have to say evie and that's based on overall growth at this point it should be only elevation how do you drive important silky's outfit was the least polished on the runway tonight silky i would choose evie as america's nest dress superstar you have to be kind to people and she has not been the most kind of the most nice soju i would also have to say evie because i don't think her drag is on the level of everyone else in the toxics vangie based on tonight i would say evie just because i feel like she kind of left her sister a little behind ariel i would also have to say silky just based off the critiques brooklyn i would have to say silky i just didn't think the look was finished and i just don't think there's a great family resemblance plastic i agree silky just fell short who should go home tonight and why uh oh we'll start with jada ciao i would just have to say heidi because the runway look could have been stepped up britta same question the character that i didn't really understand that well out of all the girls was nikki's all right heidi i feel like the girl who has struggled the most is nikki all right crystal method i'd have to say [Music] nikki nikki doll what say you due to the challenge i would say myself i do believe that i could have been able to be whittier in my own language i have to translate what you say all right so if it wasn't you that you choose which of these other girls would you choose um i'll need you to the runway i would have to say heidi let's start with jackie cox if one of us has to go home i laughed the least at widows jen who do you think should go home tonight i would have to say widow as well all right jada i would also have to say widow gigi i agree with my sisters i would say widow all right sherry widow heidi what say you this is hard say it she's one of my best friends here and it's tearing me up to say this this is solely based off the video with us all right so widow who do you think should go home tonight and why [Music] the only other video i saw that was as bad as mine was jan's all right crystal i've known widows since i started doing drag i didn't see widow in that video i would have to say widow okay ladies one more thing before we go i would like to hear from each and every one of you which one of your sisters should go home tonight and why starting with bobo i feel so uncomfortable right now uh i'm just gonna base it on the runway i would say lemon because it just looks messy i'm sorry alona verley who should go home tonight and why i would also say lemon because i feel like wearing that is not the one in my opinion as well as yours um so i would say lemon tonight i'm gonna say based on the runway i would also say lemon because i feel like we've all put like a lot of work and everything and hers isn't up to par i'll also have to say lemon i like lemon but i don't like that outfit rita becca i would say ilona because i thought she was playing herself during the challenge priyanka based on the maxi challenge and the runway in my opinion i think alona verley lemon i would also have to say alone of early tonight based on the maxi challenge and the runway as well thank you ladies we have a lot to consider you may untuck in the work room while we deliberate. - real rap we don't with facades came from nothing but i beat the odds pretty queen tings with young nick minaj queen vu paul carson miss versade [Music] mother monster has arrived wait a second holy balls it's lady gaga like the real one [Applause] holy i'm on rupaul's drag race season nine and lady gaga is in the same room as me i can't tell you i have been the closest to death and you've pulled me out of it and you don't even realize what you do for people and how much you inspire people like me and all of us and i just want to tell you you're so amazing and i never thought in the world i would ever meet you and i think you're so incredible i'm so sorry i think you're so incredible oh welcome back to the miss charisma uniqueness nerve and talent pageant in this next category our contestants return to the stage wearing their very best lady gaga drag first up peppermint grammy awards 2016. if it ain't broke don't fix it ground control to major time giving you gaga bowie realness because the entire point of drag is to give

nicola for machete was there i am wearing the look she wore for the cfda awards i definitely see myself a bit in lady gaga because she carries herself with grace and glamour but i always want to add

telephone video yes guilty as charged i decided to do the telephone look i just want to give them something big and glamorous and kind of risky couture got my titties on my chin cinch pull and tuck

wig i believe i believe it is i think yes i've chosen to wear the outfit that lady gaga wore for the 2010 brit awards i've done lady gaga hundreds of times on youtube and i think i'm pretty polished so i'm fairly confident philip tracy made this for mcqueen and he gave it to me because i was doing a tribute to him don't be a drag be a mcqueen next up pheromone the alejandro video pray and slay oh my god look at her cross i look exactly like lady gaga in my alejandro music video look and i'm rocking my real hair and i really hope that lady gaga lives for it the attitude in the face is really

an a-man next up sasha velour the applause video do i have something on my face i'm wearing my favorite look that she has ever done a pro clown high art pat mcgrath makeup it is the place where art

bodice that way wonderful job darling and thank you for bringing my globe with you it's versace snatching trophies shay coulee monster ball tour paws up baby my lady gaga look it's ethereal powerful yet gentle and serene and it mixes engineering and fashion this reminds me of the film that nick knight did with the yellow electric uh urine blonde urine blonde is my screen name on scruff it is that's my password on netflix trinity taylor american horror story hotel yes countess yes this look speaks to me because i love darkness and glamour and vampires and lady gaga was so seductive and sexy and brilliant in the show trinity a little club soda will take that right out no they say that if you use your own spit the enzymes break down the blood so good to know thank you this competition is cutthroat kimura black lady gaga on the go this is the versace phase i'm giving a look that gaga wears to like the airport i think picking out what she's done for red carpets is so predictable and it's so like all right done those boots they remind me of the pleasers that i used to get off of um hollywood boulevard yep no if's answer butts about it no ma'am james mansfield the cover of vogue oh i am serving you gaga on the cover of vogue my drag is campy and different so i'm giving you lady gaga and slumberland i look amazing if they don't like this dress don't blame me blame marc jacobs oh she's a little sleepy it's marc jacobs she's narcoleptic she's actually not wrong either because i was so tired the day that we did that shoot that that's probably what i look like in between shots cover girl put some gel in your hair nina benina brown vmas 2009 oh my god yes mcqueen yeah this was one of the biggest nights of my life i'm serving you the black version of lady gaga a lot of hips a lot of ass and a lot of sass i can't see how lady gaga is reacting because i can't see anybody i just love the expression in her face when she wears this outfit you know you can tell she's happy oh no she's on the edge of horry up next aja come to garcon now where did i park my car for my lady gaga look i'm wearing a remake of her come de garcon look that she wore to show that beauty has no shape you know i wore this because the media was saying i was fat and i knew this archive so i called calm de garcon and i asked him if we could wear it it's such an excellent choice and very slimming it's all about the waist ladies you represent the tops and the bottoms of the week now before the judging begins i have an announcement tonight there's one more queen i'd like to add to this competition [Music] we have enough we already got eureka from last season oh my god y'all are killing me a queen we all know and love please welcome back to the main stage pheromone [Music] you have to bring pharah another season 9 girl i'm like wait a minute pheromone got some work done [Music] you look beautiful in every single way thank you tell me why do you deserve to return to the competition i only have one thing to say [Music] my queen say hello to the one and only christina aguilera i want to like run on stage and like grab her and touch her but i know security will probably check me so that's why i didn't make that move christina you may join the other judges come on over baby not only do i live for christina aguilera but i live for christina aguilera i'm going to tell you one thing about season 10. when you think you know what's going on you don't know nothing i have never been this close to a famous person in my life and i am beside myself girl it is christina aguilera i have a serious question as a super fan yeah when are you gonna bring out some new music because yes what is this we've been playing every time something comes out and you know how the blogs and everything i'm like they leaked something i'm like this on top of it i know i know i promise promise promise it's coming the first song i ever did in drag was fighter that's a good one can i ask a question so was that about someone because i'm reading the lyrics girl you read him for the back when you said you tried to take a joyride and it came down in flames i said [Applause] she read him no alimony yeah he deserves it so inspiring who is puerto rican because you know i might be related let him take me too infatuated i know i know it was heartbreaking because i found out he played for your team not [Applause] mine so what has been your favorite part about this like how about this for what advice would you give to us entertainers for our future careers that's wonderful that are about to take off i think you guys already know you're doing it i mean just keep living wow i am so in awe and inspired by everything i'm i'm seeing today and we all have come from some journey i'm sure we've all had like a painful place or a struggle or something and i think that's really relevant and that's a part of my music and a part of where i come from being taken advantage of created fighter you know growing up in this business at a young age and you could just imagine being around older men a lot and dishonest people and it's really hard once you do obtain a certain level of success you can become jaded and you can see certain people around you change and that can make you change and feel guarded or shut down and weird but i think as long as you keep remembering who you are as a person keep remembering the good and the good around you then nothing can stop you yeah well welcome to the drag race family christina thanks guys [Music] [Applause] are you serious for the second time you're gonna do this i guess she's gonna give me a freaking heart attack i think miley cyrus is the most adorable little thing i love her let me get that dress miley cyrus is here hey y'all do i look different from earlier honey i cannot believe this transformation is everything i look like a truck and i look like i love it i love this show i love being here yeah we've been watching since season one but now everybody else watching too because it's all mainstream i just i loved that i got to see everyone before i love that because it's so fun for me to watch your art miley i appreciate your words so much you're just encouraging and everything and like everything that you say is just so clear to me you know what i mean like resonance i love individuality i love people being who they are and i think no matter what the judges think you have to be happy you have to be comfortable you have to love what you're in and i mean i would rather have pride and have dignity than to go out there and be something i'm not and why would you go show the world someone else because when they go to the show they're going to go who is that you know who is that yeah and so i think no matter what you should try to allow people at home to see themselves in you and no one sees themselves in perfection because nobody is and if they're pretending and they're fake and they know inside how they really feel they know they got this yeah they're fake and you don't want to be fake you'd rather be real and you know today none of us are doing the job we don't want to do at least we're doing i mean our feet hurt but besides that it's not that hard live y'all true we got to get cute pig i got to get in this front thing cause i'm short someone hide my vagina she out thank you [Music] [Laughter] i got one question for you yes uh-oh would you buy me a cheeseburger we will we will we will we will you gonna buy me a cheese [Music] welcome to the main stage of rupaul's drag race she's got that super bass michelle passage darling did you use the wrong door did i i mean i came in where the queen was supposed to come in through i think you're supposed to be over here please don't tell me i did

were the most lip-synced artist in the history of drag race that's fantastic news i feel honored let's meet the new rue crew first up trinity taylor and glitter for days ladies and gentlemen the cheetah girls glitter for days looks like a true tailor this tuck is fierce i think the store's all out of aquanet are we sure this is first time [Laughter] chez coulee and bay coulee oh it's beyonce and salon [Music] i am terrified this runway is a bit of a disaster but i help my sister the best i can and get my ass off that runway looks like a pump yes it does alexis michelle and ryan stardust it's like barbarella to me i hear they both give good headbands those glutes are made for stomping my little sister and i's are defying gravity in outer space judy justin and her sister booty jesse nina bonita brown and ariana benina brown i wonder where she's got her carrot from head to toe we have the ears the teeth and the face we are s m bunnies you know fierce i can see a little hair you get it yeah that's a bunny reference this is her hair she don't wear wear [Music] sasha velour and donatella velour that hat is on my bucket list where two east coast sisters in the 1940s looking to make it big in hollywood i think these are really really fashionable looks and donatella looks beautiful no wait wait a minute that look really says something what label horse peppermint and wintergreen the sleeve though yeah i think she's got a trick up her sleeve sleever alone we're sashing we're shantang and miss wintergreen she's feeling it i'm like okay girl she's sleeping on the midnight train to georgia you're the best job in the world this is so fun the time has come for you to lip-sync for your job just kidding [Music] [Music] oh heels everybody clap [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Laughter] welcome ladies it's time for the judge's critiques first up trinity taylor and glitter days the family resemblance is hard to deny and you did the most intricate choreography yeah so impressive i can barely walk in those shoes let alone like dance glitter for glitter if i didn't know better it looked like you've been doing this for a minute but beyond i think having a great partner it's about how you communicate and guide and i think this was probably the tightest presentation is that code for tuck yes exactly how's your tuck holding up the pain is real the pain is real now what do you think you're going to take from this experience i'm going to take this tape off up next shae kool-aid and here is bay kool-aid i love the dresses like kind of old-school hollywood glam but there's something about this attention to detail and about paying attention to your sister they when she turns around you can see her hairline her bra straps are hanging out the back it felt like you know there's the star sister and then there's the other sister oh i hate that it came across like you know bae was an afterthought i think shae did a great job i'm proud to be your sister up next alexis michelle and ryan stardust your browser glitter that's awesome the nails scream i am a big voluptuous but the outfits are kind of real basic it feels a little bit like a ricky's halloween costume in a bag look we're intergalactic can we have some candy you know look how close we are to the end here it's time to really dig in up next nina bonina brown faye baker and ariana bonina brown well i love animals so i think it's really cute i really do now was it challenging doing this drag transformation in front of your co-workers no in fact the teams were so sweet the art department they made little tags that said team team aaron you know what i mean so well we always say a family that drags together slays together but this is kind of a you know let down for me it's you out here in a leotard with thigh high boots and not really doing anything innovative i was screaming for a little cotton tail or a little colored glove or something just to bring this to this so there wasn't such a disconnect here and then with the performance too i thought was a little bit underwhelming i'm so excited about what you bring to this competition nina but i need you to bring it at a 10. up next sasha velour and donatella velour this looks so high fashion looks like mew mew on acid the proportion of the dress and the coat and all these pops of color i really really loved it now donatella there is something that you're doing it's strangely turning me on i learned it from watching you dear up next peppermint and wintergreen gorgeous i know [Music] [Laughter] wintergreen your face it's just really fun to look at you're just so funny i don't know why but you're like beautiful but like you make me [Music] what is it dear [Music] [Music] but the outfits clash so horribly i don't even want to look at him in the same frame but guess what i don't care because you were so fun to watch and peppermint you should thank wintergreen because she was the one who pulled you through now wintergreen do you think you'll ever do drag again who knows season 10 [Music] all stars thank you ladies and to my crew standing on stage to see you men do this it says that we as a people are moving forward and it's beautiful thank you from the bottom of my heart now while you ladies untuck backstage the judges and i will deliberate welcome all stars now it's time for the judge's critiques starting with ms kraka hello hello miss joslin opal rose that's right okay she's got a lot of nerve showing up here after all that it looked like you had 47 cats and may live in your car it was really fun it was messy it was it just we knew exactly who this person was i thought you were really into it it was hilarious overall tonight from the barbecue monologue to both of the outfits you're actually my favorite i love this dress by the way what is the top made out of it's some kind of seat belt material for hauling cars or some kind of rope it seems like stuff for straight people [Laughter] it looks really beautiful and it looks really fashion and your makeup is gorgeous all the way down to the details of the um shuttle shuttlecocks um on your feet it's really really thoughtful since the drag gods are watching i should say one thing some of the support that i got and someone that was a cheerleader for the people in the room was uh shay thank you ms cracker thank you up next jujube hello hello the first line of your monologue was hilarious because that's basically my life like sorry i'm late i didn't want to come it was hilarious the character that you wrote was really funny and the outfit matched the character the hat was ridiculous where do you find a hat with the brim there's this guy that i kind of hang out with and he had the hat and i borrowed it aha i think he got it from italy aha came in a huge box it sure did nice melons by the way let's talk about the dress though this is tablecloth all the melons that you see came from this mat i think this is very pretty but um the same details on both sides are a little bit wonky um when you turned on the runway that was kind of a little bit of a giveaway i hate this challenge but i'm very proud of myself because i actually made a dress and i also received help from shay and um i'm very grateful so thank you shay oh i love you thanks thank you juju thank you roo i declare it's blair sinclair hi darlene hi how are you so your character i appreciated the gaytona 500 moment your look was really great but for me all in all it wasn't a knee slapper i wasn't dying of laughter i felt a lot of lulls in the room it needed to be trashier for me didn't really sell the character um this runway look i do see that you put that was that like a lawn chair webbing yeah that's what i want to have on the hem to give it some movement but also like weigh it down it's looking a little messy to me i can tell when you were walking that something was undoing back here because you were kind of like holding it in and if you're gonna do that hair i say go for it i think it needs either some gloss or like just make it look either slicked or make it look dry it's kind of in between i actually love the debbie harry vibes like the blondie vibes i just think you're so beautiful and like i really love your makeup like i would love for you to do my makeup thank you blaia thank you up next shay coulee hello uh shayquida yes but you can call me little kiki little kiki i thought your play cousin couture moment um was really great immediately we had something to relate to with the grand drea from your season from 90210 i thought that was genius loved your monologue it was hilarious you had the bag of chips when you ate one of the chips like i couldn't stop watching you tonight on the runway you took a different approach to the picnic attire i think it's fun i think it's different i think it's really fresh because it has a story to it like i would wear this like i think it's dope those are the shuttle across the sweetheart neckline and i just found out that y'all called these shuttlecocks uh-huh yeah i grew up in a christian household we called them birdies we weren't playing with no up in our backyard the only thing maybe it's a there's a lot going on maybe i would have made it a tiny bit less busy but it's still really cool all right thank you obviously you are the si one of the seamstresses of the bunch yeah because it sounds like you had enough time to not only make a couture garment but also to help everybody else why not i just think it's really important that as like queer people that we all act as family i understand that this is a competition but if one of us looks good all of us look good thank you shay bam alexis matteo i loved this look tonight because when you came out here i knew right away those were solo cups and the hair is very you and then of course the big reveal you have never seen a dress with a kiddie pool built into it like i wasn't expecting it to happen then when it happened i was like that's the best thing ever like i screamed i would say that this look really floods both your basement and mine [Laughter] but i don't love the the way this mermaid kind of hemline is working because it's really cutting off your lower half into another half so the proportion is a little wonky for me the uh character in the beginning i know how funny you are and i felt a little let down by her the dress was plain and bright green and then the reveal to the hair was really small i just felt like it was kind of flat i wish she would have kept the pink wig on i didn't like the red wig i just like the pink wig i thought that it was a great idea but then there wasn't quite enough there for me to sink my teeth into thank you ladies i think i've heard enough we are at the point in the competition that if you're not the top you're in the bottom based on the judge's critiques i've made some decisions [Music] ms cracker congratulations you are the top all-star of the week [Music] you've won a five night's day for two plus airfare at the lalit london in london in galen my favorite place in the world juju blair shea alexis you are the bottom all-stars of the week [Music] ms cracker you need to decide which bottom queen to send home if you win the lip sync against this week's lip sync assassin the rest of you need

feathers are really 2 - and we're gonna need a higher deal [Music] you have so much opportunity and privilege allotted to you and you have so many talents and don't hesitate from exploring them and really reaching for the stars but also when you're 21 there's gonna be a really really strange man in the way calling it on the phone inviting you to come to LA say yes and from an early age you have the charisma uniqueness nerve and talent and if you thought you are interested in drag starting in the seventh grade you're wrong it started when you were three thank you thank you aja O'Hara what

happiness to your life when you realize that it's okay to be a bigger person and to be proud of it and when you do finally realize it you're gonna be able to bring so much happiness to your family and to the people you're around and to people all over the world that are also lost and you know that feels like and you get the opportunity to give that back to the army so you stay strong and don't throw scissors at your sister when you're 7 thank you all right Cameron Michaels what advice you have for three-year-old Dane you're such a happy child and that's probably gonna change in a couple years you're gonna feel very lost and alone like you don't have a place in the world until you become the person that you're meant to be and then you'll know that different wasn't bad and different is good you have two loving parents and one of them is not gonna be here to see this moment so hug him and tell him that you love him and don't hide around the corner with the karaoke machine and sing

But first, she's got to put her money where her funny is. (gasping) And I'm not joking, bitch. Where are the jokes? (bass beat) - Hello. (crowd clapping) Good evening ladies and gentlemen. Anybody else on their period? (crowd laughing) You know, I'm a little bit into the horror movies. Can you guess which one? "Carrie", yes. How many people have seen "Carrie" actually? Let's see. Good. Good. The real special thing about Carrie is that she has telekinetic powers. Telekinesis means that you can move things with your mind. The last time I moved anything with my head, it was in a motel room (crowd laughing) the John through $40 on my (beep) and told me to get the (beep) out. (crowd laughing) I was like I'm leaving, (beep) leaving. Good God. You ain't gotta yell at me like that. I'll see you at home dad. (crowd laughing) (upbeat music) - I'm a drag queen. When you first start doing drag it's like you want to be the fishiest, you want to have the best body, but now I want to be a fat girl. I want to be a fat girl. You can get (beep) from anywhere. Every guy wants to secretly (beep) a fat bitch, number one. So I'm not gonna have no man problems, okay? I want to be like really fat. I want to get pregnant and not even know it. (crowd laughing) Have you seen those specials on TV? And it's usually a big girl. It's like, of course she didn't know she was (beep) pregnant. (crowd laughing) You know what I mean? I want to go to the bathroom, sit on the toilet and become a mother. (crowd laughing) Okay? No matter what size I am, I will be the body beautiful. Always. Okay? Do you want to see? A little preview. (crowd cheering) And I will still (beep) turn it darling, always. (upbeat music) - Woo! (crowd cheering) Yes bitches! It is not Angelina Jolie. It is not Beyonce. It's your girl Alexis all the way from Puerto Rico. (yelling in Spanish) (crowd cheering) Honey. And I am so excited because I always wanted to be a star honey. So I left Puerto Rico behind and I moved to United States, all the way to Florida. I did travel in first class, right in front of that boat, baby. Honey, I'm a Latina girl and I only have two options in this country, being a housekeeper or being a stripper bitches. And y'all know I didn't came here to clean toilets, baby. So I became a stripper, baby! (crowd cheering) Yes ma'am, honey, if God gave it to you baby, you better make some money. (crowd laughing) Yes ma'am. I am here and I'm queer baby! (bass beat) - Mm-hm. I said bitch better have my money. Right? Let me tell you something baby, they call me Laqueefa. Laqueefa the P and P. Now that stands for the postmodern pimp-ho. (crowd laughing) Postmodern pimp-ho means yes I'm still a pimp, but I'm also my own ho. (crowd laughing) That's right. 'Cause of the recession y'all, I'm telling you, I done have to scale back, you know? And sometimes I don't even pay myself my own money. (crowd laughing) Uh-huh. If I did maybe I could get some shoes so my toes weren't hanging five inches off the edge. (crowd laughing) Yeah. I know you trying to clown me for my cliffhangers. Yeah. I saw it. You know, and they always trying to clown me on the block, baby. They always saying "Laqueefa!" I say "What?" (crowd laughing) They say "Laqueefa, where your ho's at?" I said, "Bitch, don't you see "I'm wearing four pair of hose right here "holding back my (beep)?" (crowd laughing) You know, I had a dumb-ass girlfriend that went and joined PETA. She came screaming at me last week, talking like "Laqueefa!" I said "What?" (crowd laughing) She said "Laqueefa, don't you know "how many innocent animals had to die "for you to have that fur coat?" I said "Bitch, "do you know how many rich animals "I had to (beep) to get this coat?" (crowd laughing) Stupid bitch! (upbeat music) (crowd cheering) - Hi everyone. My parents weren't really big about the TV. I really only had like PBS and "Sesame Street." "Sesame Street" was one gay-ass block. (crowd laughing) Okay, obviously we have Bert and Ernie, I mean they're so gay they practically are board members of "GLAD." Um. Now, one of my favorite people that lives on Sesame Street is the Count. He's one of those old, Liberace gays. And he loves collecting chachkies like Faberge eggs. One Faberge egg. Two Faberge egg. Three Faberge egg. Ah-ah-ah. (crowd laughing) (upbeat Latin American music) (crowd cheering) (crowd laughing) (crowd cheering) - Hi. I'm Yara Sofia. I'm gonna make a long story short. I met a guy in a club and he took me to a wonder restaurant he called McDonald's. (crowd laughing) "Do you want a chicken sandwich?" What the heck is chicken? She told me "Chicken means polla." Polla means (beep) in Spain! (crowd laughing) I said "I don't want to eat a (beep) sandwich." After that he took me to the apartment and he took her clothes off. Oh my god, what the hell is that? It was huge. The difference between an onion and a 14-inch (beep), both maked me cry. (crowd laughing) (crowd cheering) (fart sound) Get out! Get out! Get out! Get out! Get out! Get out! Get out! Get out! There was (beep) all over the bed. I felt like Willie Wonka's chocolate factory! (RuPaul laughing) (upbeat music) (crowd cheering) - My name's Delta Work. I'm in my early to, early 30's. And I'm here in Southern California just kind of looking for love, you know? And it's kind of hard for a big girl like me because it's so body conscious in L.A. and it freaks me out to think who is gonna want a girl like me? (crowd laughing) What? Is that funny? (crowd laughing) Like I see these stories about these girls, they go out running and then they get like abducted and assaulted and you know it's like I have to eat frozen burritos. I have to watch the marathon of "Hoarders." Because if I go out and exercise, I'm gonna get raped. (crowd laughing) You guys have been an amazing audience, thank you so much for coming out. We appreciate you coming out. (crowd cheering) (bass beat) (upbeat music) (crowd cheering) - Hey! (crowd cheering) My name is Miss Darienne Lake. I like to say miss 'cause it lets the boys know I'm single. (crowd laughing) You know? Of course my 14 cats and my appearance on "Hoarders, Buried Alive" might also let them know I'm single. (crowd laughing) I asked my mother, I'm like "Mom, "how did I end up so twisted? "Like did you like drop me on my head when I was a baby?" She was like "Honey, you have to be held to be dropped." (crowd laughing) I am here representing all the big and curvy girls. - Hey. (crowd clapping) - I'm trying to get in shape. I mean, well round is a shape, you know? - [Crowd Member] Yes, it is. - At the gym, I'm like a ninja. You will never see me there. (crowd laughing) I know we got some old people here in the audience tonight. Yes, how y'all doing? Yeah, did you guys all come together on the ark? (crowd laughing) Tell Noah I say "Hello." (crowd laughing) - As you may have all gathered from my accent, I am from Idaho. (crowd laughing) I'm kidding. I'm from Australia. Land of kangaroos, land of Olivia Newton-John, and "throw another shrimp on the barbie." - Yeah. - Well, what if I don't want shrimp thrown on me? (crowd laughing) I want to look fishy, not smell fishy. All right? (crowd laughing) So, I moved to America recently. I moved to West Hollywood. And I've written a little bit of a song about some of the people that I've met there and I'd like to sing it for you now. ♪ They'll take you down with just one look ♪ ♪ They hunt in packs, they don't read books ♪ ♪ Injectable tans and old tattoos ♪ ♪ Too young for Botox, got nothing to lose ♪ ♪ They're the mean gays, they live in West Hollywood ♪ ♪ They're the mean gays ♪ ♪ They'll take your wood if they could ♪ ♪ I'm a mean gay ♪ ♪ Well you would if you could ♪ ♪ I might look nice but do think twice ♪ ♪ Before you take me on ♪ (crowd clapping) (upbeat music) Thank you. - Hi. You're probably wondering why I look like a Mexican Katy Perry right now aren't you? My mother is a chola. Do you guys know what a chola is? Can I get a show of hands? Yeah, we're in L.A. mother-(beep). Yeah. (man laughing) My mom's a chola and she likes big (beep). Okay. No, yeah. I was really scared when I heard that senior citizens were gonna be in the (beep) audience tonight, okay? Just blame my (beep) grandma because she likes to go to TJ and get work done so I never grasped the concept to respect my elders. The bitch never ages. She has a fake ass and a fake hip, and I'm pretty sure the ass came first and broke the hip so I don't know what the hell she's doing. But anyways, my grandma's a whore. No? Okay cool. It's my first time people. (laughing nervously) You guys having fun? (crowd cheering) - Yeah. (upbeat music) - I'll mow your lawns later. - My name is BenDeLaCreme, hold for applause. Okay. And I'm delighted to be here with a live audience. I love it when there's people just right in front of me and I can feel like I could just reach right out and touch you if I wanted to. I don't want to, don't worry about that. But I feel like I could if I wanted to which is a great option to have. I'm far away from my hometown of Seattle, Washington. It's the city that never dries, but you know its rain is not so bad. It is a moist area, but it's my moist area and I love it. A lot of people come there you just need to wear the right protection, you know? There's a lot of stereotypes about Seattleites, but they're really just regular folk. Extremely regular folk. You know, caffeine, all in line for the restroom. We love a good rest. But, um, but, I digress. The point is I feel like I've learned to sort of weave a story, bring somebody on an arc that really ends somewhere, where they feel like the whole thing's been meaningful and they're gonna wind up with something that made the whole thing worthwhile. - [Man In Crowd] So tell us a joke. (bass note) - Good night everybody. - [Michelle] Wow. (upbeat music) (crowd clapping) - Hey, hey, hey, hey! Put your lighters up! Ganja's in the house! Yeah-ow! As you can tell from my accent, I am from Dallas, Tex-ass. And it was not very easy growing up looking like this. Whether I was playing in my grandma's clothes or putting on a show for my well-organized, alphabetically ordered beanie-babies, I was gug-guh-guh-gay. Okay? But it wasn't until I moved to Los Angeles that I discovered marijuana. I mean I like to smoke. Y'all I am just flying as high as your receding hairline, okay? (crowd groaning) Marijuana really does help me calm down. So y'all, I went to Valencia where they filmed the TV show "Weeds." Now, y'all, it's very dry. It's almost kind of like your vagina. (crowd groaning) Can I get an amen? Now y'all, I am a tree-hugger because if it ain't green, ha, I'm not interested, okay? (scattered clapping) (upbeat music) - Get up and show me some love. Come on. Get up. Show me some love. Get up. I got an honest (beep). Honest track. This stuff is hot. (crowd clapping) Thank you. Thank you. This ain't easy. I am not a comedian so go ahead sit down. Sit down. Sit down. Sit down. (beep) (beep) Sit down. (laughing) So if you all have not already noticed, I am black. But don't be worried, you know, you don't have to hold onto your purses and your wallets, I already got 'em. (crowd laughing) Growing up for me was really hard because we were really poor. We were like "Good Times" poor. It was really, really gay. (RuPaul laughing) And um, the only way we had the opportunity to eat was my mother would read us recipes from a cook book. (crowd laughing) And oh how I got full many nights off of the roast beef on page 27. (crowd laughing) But a really unfortunate thing happened, my sister caught an ear infection so she starved to death. (crowd laughing) I really grew up a lot with my grandmother. I stayed at my grandmother's house, one, because she was just a sweet lady and two, because she had food. (crowd laughing) But, she had this really crazy obsession with her bills. And it was the light bill in particular. Everything involved the light bill. Stop running around my house like that, you're gonna run my light bill up. (crowd laughing) Stop flushing that toilet so much, you're gonna run my damn light bill up. (crowd laughing) Stop breathing so much, you're gonna run my light bill up. I just feel like I can be myself and just let my hair down with all of you people. - [Crowd Member] Whoa! (crowd laughing) - Good time. It's a party. It's a party! (crowd cheering) Yes! - You know, I've suffered from ADHD all of my life. It's a constant struggle every day. (crowd aww-ing) Ooh look, a rhinestone (giggling). (crowd laughing) But I'm always getting (beep) you know. "Oh, you're so skinny why don't you just eat something." Or "Eat a cheeseburger you skinny bitch." And all I want to say is "Well then give me something to eat, "I'm (beep) starving!" So I've got a little theory going here. Ever since I've come to the show and I've met RuPaul, I have a little theory here. I'm gonna run it by you. I've seen RuPaul in the work room out of drag. I see RuPaul here on the runway as a drag queen. Never in the same room at the same time. Both RuPaul's, same person. Pretty sure I cracked the code. (funky music) Just saying. (crowd cheering) - I am so excited to see the cast of "Cocoon" is here. (crowd laughing) You look fabulous! Miss! I'm over here. Bring both eyes. I'm right here! (crowd laughing) Damn, Pearl Harbor must've did ya in. (crowd laughing) On a lighter note, I'd like to let you know about my family. My mother is from Cuba and my dad is from Honduras, which basically means I have a large (beep), no credit, and a tendency to take things that don't belong to me. (crowd laughing) My mother insisted that we stay true to our Spanish heritage so my first words were "(knocking) house keeping." (crowd laughing) I like the gentleman in back who's sleeping, makes me feel right at home. Can you wake that bitch up? Yeah, the one right there with the horizontal stripes. Not a good look in your 3rd trimester sir, all right? (crowd laughing) All I've ever heard from the judges was that we need to see more versatility, and you know what I gotta say to y'all is that I will show you versatility when Santino wins a sewing competition and Visage wears a (beep) turtleneck. (crowd laughing) Ain't gonna happen! (crowd laughing) Well I gotta say I hope you guys had a lot of fun. And because I'm feeling extra special, I'm gonna put fresh tennis balls on every walker in the place. (crowd laughing) Jello, all around! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Mwah! (crowd cheering) (upbeat music) - [Announcer] Our hostesses with the mostesses, Mrs. Kasha Davis and Katya. (crowd clapping) - Oh my goodness everyone. We want to welcome you to the first annual Despy Awards. Now Katya, what in the hell does "Despy" stand for? - Well judging from the looks of the nominees, I'm gonna go with desperate, egotistical, sluts prancing in the yard. (RuPaul laughing) (crowd cheering) - [Kasha] Got it! - The talented Ginger Minj is here tonight or as I like to refer to her "the Danny DeVito of drag." (crowd laughing) - And we have in our presence Miss lame, shame, pain. - Whatever. - Whatever. - The gorgeous Pearl. The drag equivalent of a Valium taking a Xanax in a K-hole. (judges laughing) - And last but not least. - As usual. - We have - Violet. - Violet. (Violet laughing) (crowd laughing) - Please welcome to the stage the stars of Tyler Perry's "Roots", Kennedy Davenport and Miss Jaidynn Diore Fierce. (RuPaul laughing) (crowd clapping) - Hello everyone. Straight from Kunta Kinte's hut. (crowd laughing) The hourglass and the wall clock. (crowd laughing) - Hold on. Who's the wall clock? - Step over there. - Okay. - Do this. - Okay. - My point. (crowd laughing) - [Jaidynn] Anyways, we are here to present this award for the sexy, sexy drag queen. - Let us announce these awful nominees. Kandy Ho! - And we all know how she got that last name. - In the back alley honey. - Whore. (crowd laughing) Miss Fame. - Oh, the brand. Since when did the dollar store become a brand? (crowd laughing) - And Max. Girl, ain't that the queen from that movie "Powder?" (crowd laughing) - The winner is - Girl. (drum roll) - Miss Fame! (brass music) (crowd cheering) - I wish I could cry but goddamn Botox got me every time. Other than that I'd like to thank Mexico for the tapeworm that snatched my body. And the man upstairs, thank you so much for the light. I look great! (crowd laughing) Thank you so much! - [Announcer] Next up. Pearl and Max. - It is a true honor to be presenting the Despy Award for most busted drag queen. What is a busted drag queen? I'm glad you asked. - Oh yes. The nominees are Mrs. Potato, I mean Miss Jaidynn Diore Fierce. (crowd laughing) - Miss Ginger Minj. Girl. After we swing on by gator land, we can get on back to my apartment and swing on my husband. (crowd laughing) The Brooke Hogan of drag, Katya. (crowd laughing) - And last but certainly not youngest, Mrs. Kasha Davis. (crowd laughing) - Did you hear that dear? (RuPaul laughing) And the winner is (drum roll) (gasping) - Jaidynn Diore Fierce! (brass music) (crowd cheering) - Thank you to all my fellow horrible drag queens. I hope you all burn in hell. (RuPaul laughing) And I mean it. (crowd cheering) - [Announcer] Next up, Ginger Minj and Kandy Ho. - I am so honored to be here at the first annual Despy Awards. - And I'm working off community service. (crowd laughing) - We've gathered the very best to present the award for the shadiest shade. (Ginger gasping) - Congratulations Kandy! Oh, I think it's high time that your beard gets the public recognition it deserves. (crowd laughing) - No, no Ginger. This award is for that girl who knows how to throw the shade and not apply it. - And the nominees are - the girl who puts the fun in ele-funt, Ginger Minj. (crowd laughing) - The, how do I say this and remain socially responsible? "Black horse" of the competition, Kennedy Davenport. (crowd laughing) - And last, as usual, Violet Chachki! And the award goes to Violet Chachki! (brass music) (crowd cheering) - You don't like me. You really don't like me! And last but not least, God, thanks. (RuPaul laughing) (crowd clapping) - Next up, Miss Fame and Violet Chachki. - Are there any married couples in the house? Michelle Visage, how long? - 17 years. - Ooh girl, no, how long? (crowd laughing) - As someone who is highly experienced with handling meat, I cannot wait to hear the nominees for meatiest tuck. - Oh, so you work in meat packing? - [Violet] You could say that. - Oh. - Then let's go ahead and receive the nominees. - [Fame] Katya, VIP. - Very impressive package. Jaidynn Diore Fierce. - Hey girl! - Meatiest tuck? Girl, let's be honest, looks like she smuggled a honey-baked ham in her panties. (crowd laughing) That brings us to our last nominee. Pearl. - Pearl. - Pearl's tucking ability is just like her personality, semi-precious, exhausted, and barely there. (crowd laughing) And the Despy Award goes to Katya! (brass music) (crowd cheering) - I believe it was the great American painter Bob Ross who said (RuPaul laughing) "The key to a swollen vagina is courage." (RuPaul laughing) (crowd cheering) - Have a good night everyone. Thank you so much. (crowd cheering) (crowd cheering) (upbeat music) - Hi everybody! Well I'm gonna be your hostess and MC. I'm just gonna start off with saying I'm sorry. (crowd laughing) So um, how many of y'all saw season 5? Season 5, "RuPaul's Drag Race?" (crowd cheering) You saw the roast? Yeah, I suck. I suck more than Michelle Visage at a truck stop with a glory hole, right? So listen, I'm here, you know, just struggling, another thing I struggle with is my weight. Anybody struggle with weight? - Woo! - Yeah, girl. I mean I just don't know how to get rid of those extra pounds. And these damn airports, you know, the bags can only be 50 pounds and it costs a lot of money to look this cheap, you know? But I'm so excited, are y'all ready for some real comedy? - [Crowd] Yeah! - 'Cause I'm dying up here ladies and gentlemen. Now, I'm not the funniest. (crowd laughing) - You killed that one sis! (crowd laughing) - First up out of the gate, besides myself, is these two girls. One thing that they do love is the color orange. Coco Montrese and Phi Phi O'Hara! (crowd cheering) (funky music) - Woo! Hey daddy. - Oh my God, Cocita, there you are! (crowd laughing) How's everything out here on the strip tonight? - Oh girl it ain't going to good honey. The last john I sat on, woof, I had Mexican food, it wasn't that good. - Man, I'm so sorry to hear that, but I have a little favor to ask of you. - What you want girl? - Think you could do my makeup? - Sit down. I got my good stuff. - Oh my God I'm so excited. You know every time I'm on like your social medias and stuff. - Mm-hm. - I'm always looking at your pictures and I'm like oh my God, no filters. - Mm-hm. (crowd laughing) - Okay, well first tell me what is the first step in this, you know, Cocita makeup tutorial? - First, you gotta take that bag of cheesy chips girl. - Okay. Okay. (crowd laughing) - Crush it up real good. - Okay. Okay. - Then you gotta, you gotta just take it and beat that face. - Oh, oh. - I mean girl you got to beat it, beat it like you stole something. (crowd laughing) So what's this audition for anyway? - Well I'm gonna be an actress. - Girl, I hope it's not a musical. You know any instrument you play you gotta blow. - That's not true mama, I've been writing a lot of stuff. ♪ Jump in a car ♪ ♪ And jump out ♪ ♪ The cops are coming, put the hands on the hood ♪ - Girl, hold on. Hold on. Hold on girl. I got something for you. - Oh, what's this? - I got you a key. - A key? - 'Cause you can't seem to find one girl. (funky music) - [Katya] Coco and Phi Phi are not so much doing a comedy routine, but a live-action off, off, off, off Broadway theater production of "Hookers at the Point." (crowd cheering) - Hey there! What seems to be going on? (crowd cheering) (judges laughing) So Rocky was bombing up here, so yeah, she asked me to come and finish the show for her. You don't wanna see anymore of her, right? My name is Tasha Salad. I was on season 5 of "Rupaul's Drag Race." Do you remember? I'm so excited to be here. I just got off the best Italian vacation. I was over in the beautiful Thousand Island on a beautiful ranch. And let me tell you, I flew in just to try and save her ass. Are you ready for some more comedy? Are you ready? Are you ready? Are you ready? (crowd cheering) Ladies and gentlemen, she is the blue cheese to the other one's crumbles. (crowd laughing) Make some noise, this is Alyssa Edwards and Alaska! (upbeat music) (crowd cheering) - My name is Alaska, just like the state. - My name is Alyssa Edwards. - Yes. - And this definitely ain't nobody's secret, that this gigorama is completely full of buffoonery, (crowd laughing) rigory, (crowd laughing) and straight up tomfoolery. (crowd laughing) - Totally. (crowd laughing) Alyssa, we're in the company of some amazing queens tonight. - Where? (crowd laughing) - Ouch. (crowd laughing) Detox and Tatianna are here. - The heels have eyes part two, the remix. (crowd laughing) - Bam. (crowd laughing) Alyssa, describe Michelle Visage in one word. Go. (drum roll) - Beast! (crowd laughing) - Burn. (crowd laughing) Alyssa, I want to thank you so much for being my partner tonight. Don't worry, if drag doesn't work out, you'll always have something to fall back on. Your back rolls. (crowd laughing) - These next two girls, let me tell you, they are so nutty. Besides walnuts and almonds, these are my favorite nuts ladies and gentlemen. Make some noise! This is Ginger Minj and Katya! (crowd cheering) (upbeat music) - It's not the first time she's gotten clap from a room full of people. (crowd laughing) Well hey y'all! How are you? You know I'm so excited to be here tonight, sharing the stage with my BFF, Katya! (crowd cheering) Now I know most of you might be sitting out there asking yourself "Self", that's what you say, you say "Self, "now how does a delicate, petite, "little cross dresser for Christ "become best friends with a disease-riddled, "low-rent, Russian whore?" (crowd laughing) - You see I spend most of my time on my back while she tries to find someone to shave hers. (crowd laughing) - It's funny 'cause it's true (laughing). Seriously, this one right here has more fish than an all you can eat seafood buffet. - That's funny Ginger. I'm sure you know all about the buffet, you know because you're fat. (crowd laughing) - Shut up. I will turn you into immigration, balky. All right? (crowd laughing) - But through it all, we have plunged head-first into the most beautiful friendship and we have never looked back. Mostly because she doesn't have a neck and she can't really turn her head. (crowd laughing) Thank you all so much. Good night! - No, bitch, get back here! I got asthma but I will catch you. (crowd laughing) - Ladies and gentlemen, do I look a little slimmer to you? Like I lost some weight? Do you wanna know my secret? I started using light dressing. (scattered clapping) Get it? - [Drag Queen] We got it girl. We got it. - Okay, next up, well one of these girls, she is so fishy. She is the sardines in Caesar dressing. The other girl prefers un-cut carrots in her salad. Make some noise! This is Detox and Tatianna! (upbeat music) (crowd cheering) - Hey! Hello! Hello! Hello! My name is Lydia Ladybits. - And I'm Beatrice Backdoor. (crowd laughing) Thank y'all so much for coming to tonight's event. It's a benefit for Babies Battling Bulimia. (crowd laughing) - But I already see there's a bevy of beautiful, bitter bitches already here hitting the buffet. (crowd laughing) Be and I met last year at Patty's Pooches with Prolapse garden party. We did. - Oh my God. - The rosebuds were in full bloom. - The assholes were out, literally. (crowd laughing) Especially this one's date. - Date? I came alone. - You came with Carlos the gardener! (crowd laughing) Well, what? You were blowing saliva water balloons. (crowd laughing) And all you guys are here, giving your time and your money to this lovely benefit for teeny-tiny, teeny-tiny tots. But I just want to know when you're gonna have some teeny-tiny tots of your own their Be? - I've always wanted some. My doctor keeps telling me that my test, that my ovaries are just getting in the way. (crowd laughing) You know, I've always wanted to tell you something. There's a secret behind the woman that you see here today. - Oh no, is there really? - Oh this is hard for me to say. - It's okay dar, spit it out. No matter what you're about to tell me, you will always be in my eyes, my best girl friend. (crowd laughing) - You see, I used to have braces. (crowd laughing) - Oh Be! You are incredible Be! We'll see you next year. Oh, oh no. That Sally Field, that (beep) lied to me about the Boniva. - Come on. - Let's do it. (crowd cheering) - Ladies and gentlemen, the joy is on the show, say yeah! (crowd cheering) We want to thank you guys for coming out tonight. And if you can't laugh at yourself, how in the hell are you gonna laugh at somebody else? Can I get an amen? - [Crowd] Amen! - Good night! (upbeat music) - Michelle, is that Dahlia? - Yes. She's stalking us. - Oh. The Big Pink Furry Box Theater presents "Jackie Cox: Between Two Parents." (crowd cheering) - Hello! Hello! Now it may be hard to believe from what you see in front of you, but both of my parents are scientists. (crowd laughing) my father is a mild-mannered Canadian with a very dry sense of humor. My mother is from Iran and like many immigrant parents, had a very clear list of things that she wanted me to accomplish to fulfill her dreams. Top of which is become a doctor. And nowhere on this list (crowd laughing) was drag queen. Bouncing between these two households, my parents clearly did not stay married, was something that challenged me in many different ways. Take my mother for instance, I'm maybe 12 years old, watching the TV. (crowd laughing) - What is this? (crowd laughing) I do not approve of these Spice Girls. This is too sexy-mexy. Go to your room and go study your book on male anatomy. Well you don't have to tell me twice. (crowd laughing) So I hear you are interested in performing and music and dancing. I believe in you. Okay, first things first, we're gonna start with ballet and then jazz and then tap and then all of the dancing starting from Flamenco to Salsa. Dad, this is a lot. I don't know if that's what I want to do. But a few years later I started to get a little bit of an idea. Me and a few friends sneak out and we drive down to Chicago Gay Pride. And that's when I see them for the first time. They look eight feet tall, giant high heels, giant hair. These aren't just women, these are drag queens. And I am mesmerized. (crowd clapping) I decide to take home a little souvenir. A beautiful white feather boa with sparkly parts in it too. I get home, sneak that boa, hide it up in the top-most corner of my closet. (crowd laughing) What is this? (crowd laughing) If my mom can get past the fact that I'm a drag queen on national television, hopefully she'll get over this impression of her. And what have I figured out? Having someone in your corner who is always cheering you on and believes in you, that's love. And I learned that having someone who always wants to make sure that nothing bad will ever happen to you, that's real love. And I also learned to hide that feather boa a little better. (crowd laughing) (crowd cheering) Thank you guys! (crowd cheering) (upbeat music) - I'm a little worried having to follow this act because she definitely put a lot of herself and her heart in it, and I'm not playing myself at all. - Next, Crystal Methyd in "Phenomenal Phil, Exotic Dance Instructor." (dance music) (crowd cheering) - Thank you, thank you! How we doing tonight ladies? (crowd cheering) (judges laughing) All right, well I'm Phenomenal Phil, exotic dance instructor to the stars. (RuPaul laughing) I worked with Channing Tatum. I taught him how to do "the worm." (crowd laughing) I've also taught Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson how to do "the sprinkler." (crowd cheering) (RuPaul laughing) I even taught Betty White how to do "the jerk." (crowd cheering) (judges laughing) Are y'all ready to start feeling yourself? (crowd cheering) I brought you moves from my dance training DVD "Fill Me Up." (Whoopi laughing) (crowd cheering) This first move is "the litter box." But (crowd laughing) get yourself in the mind of a pussycat. And then you gotta get that soiled sand like out of here! Get it out! (crowd laughing) And then we're gonna dump it, okay? (crowd oh-ing) Get it out! (crowd laughing) Fill her up! We're not done yet. But we probably got some on our legs, so give a little bit of this, (crowd laughing) a little of that. - All right, Crystal. She's killing it out here. (crowd woo-ing) You might have to change your name to Phenomenal Phil after this performance. - This is my big money maker. It's "the Brazilian banana inspector." (crowd ooh-ing) Start up and just find the banana in the tree. I think they grow on trees. (crowd laughing) Pull it down and then you gotta make sure you work the nips on the way down. So (mumbling). (crowd laughing) And a little bit of that! And then we work it down to the hips. (crowd cheering) (RuPaul laughing) All right everybody. I think that's about all the time I have for today. I'll be in the back selling my DVD but only for about 20 minutes because I'm performing at a bar mitzvah later! (crowd laughing) (upbeat music) Thank you! (crowd cheering) - Up next, Heidi Aphrodite in "Cookout With Your Cheeks Out." - Ooh, y'all look so good! Y'all look so good. I really just want to give y'all some of my hometown livin'. The first member of my family I want you to meet is my grandmother. She's the one who raised me and she really hates everyone. (crowd laughing) Let me introduce you to grandmother. 'Bout time all y'all got here in my house! Now y'all best stop opening up my door and stuff. I don't pay to air-condition the outside. Oh Lord have mercy here comes Sharon with that nasty-ass potato salad. Oh Lord. (crowd laughing) Hello. Hello, how are you all doing? I brought the potato salad. Don't worry, I'm a put it right here in the middle. Now Sharon, I done told you about that potato salad. You don't season it. You don't put the right potatoes in it. You don't even put mustard in it. (gasping) How dare you talk about my potato salad! And there's always Uncle Rob, the drunk. (crowd laughing) Why y'all... (hiccuping) (crowd lady laughing) Why y'all fightin'? Rob, I done told you, take your drunk-ass and sit down somewhere, always in somebody's business. The party don't start 'til cousin Slick walks in. Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo wassup? (mumbling gibberish) Wassup, wassup, wassup yo. Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo. Yo what's here to eat? Aunt Sharon says "You know, it's my potato salad here. "You know, it's so good." No, no, no Aunt Sharon. No, no, no. You know the last time I had your potato salad (laughing) I had to blow that bathroom up! (crowd laughing) Dumb-ass. (crowd laughing) Just you wait and see Sharon. I'm gonna laugh right in your face. - Heidi is not giving what I expected from Heidi. - Yo, yo, yo, I gotta go. Bye, bye, bye, bye. - Baby, the ship is, it's not sinking but there's a few holes in it. - Have a good night everybody. (crowd cheering) - The Furry Box Theater presents Gigi Goode in "Welcome Aboard Brimstone Airways." (crowd cheering) (upbeat music) - Good morning sinners. Welcome aboard Brimstone Airways flight 666, non-stop to hell. (crowd laughing) Right, you all did something in your lives to piss off the big guy upstairs. I'm gonna let you know why a couple of you are here, all right? Let's see. You. You in the front row in this ripped-up denim jacket, what's your name? - Derek. - Gary, nice to meet you Gary. (crowd laughing) Gary. Your credit score sucks Gary. (crowd laughing) You. What's your name? - Morgan. - I'm gonna call you Karen from now on. Is that okay? (crowd laughing) I'm gonna tell you why you're on your way to hell Karen, it's because you're a goddamn hippocrite. (crowd laughing) All right? I see you mixing textiles. (crowd oh-ing) He's paying attention. (crowd laughing) Give me one second. I'm gonna gather my extremely important tools. (opening drawer) All right. If you'll kindly familiarize yourself with the lack of exits on this aircraft. You look to my left and right, that's right, no exits here. (crowd laughing) Okay? For your in-flight snacks we have just one option. It's peanuts. (crowd ah-ing) Unsalted peanuts. (crowd laughing) Welcome to hell, bitch. (crowd laughing) Okay, let's see where I'm at now. All right. So. - I love Gigi's concept but I'm seeing Gigi kind of trying to remember her outline and keep going back to it when she's on a roll on different jokes. - Okay. All right. So, when we do land, something will magically open, then you'll get off and immediately engulfed in flames. So as stated before, that tiny piece of fabric with metal attached to it is not gonna protect you from (beep) Karen. (crowd laughing) Or you Gary. (crowd laughing) I see you're wearing distressed denim, it's 2020. (crowd laughing) Let's keep that in mind. All right, I've just received word from the captain that we are beginning our initial decent. On behalf of Brimstone Airways, I want to thank you for choosing us as your means of transportation today. And please, enjoy your stay in Detroit. (crowd laughing) Thank you. Burn in hell. Thank you. Go (beep) yourself Gary. (crowd laughing) - Up next, Jaida Essence Hall in "The P in Pageant." (upbeat music) (crowd cheering) - Hey blow bitches, my name is Jaida Essence Hall, and for those of you who do not know me, I am a drag queen and a badass bitch, okay? (crowd cheering) And for those of you who do know me, I am sorry. (RuPaul laughing) I'm a take you all on a tour of one of the worst experiences that has ever happened to me in my life. Now one time I was hired to judge and perform at a pageant. The girls are beautiful. They're walking around in these beautiful gowns, and I get a little shake in my right leg. Child, ooh. So I look over for a familiar face. Hey Rue! Except Rue happens to be my boyfriend. He comes on over. I'm in a situation, I'm a need a little bit of help, okay? The category is over, I push the chair back, I start to run. Baby, I have to piss. Tap him on the shoulder. Run into the bathroom. (footsteps) Ooh, y'all are not feeling it. That's (mumbling). (crowd laughing) That's all right, we're going on a journey. Okay. And I'm like okay baby. Help me out here. I'm pulling up my dress. He's all on the floor. He's fumbling around. I'm like baby come on, come on, come on, come on, come on! And then I stop. (peeing sound effect) - [Man In Crowd] Uh-oh. (peeing sound effect) (crowd laughing) - All I can do is look down at my man on the floor, (crowd laughing) looking up at me, covered in urine. I head back to the judges table, the head judge says "Please, please, please "can we get some air freshener over here?" (crowd oh-ing) - Oh no. - But then he looks over and says "These other judges to the left, "they have hot dogs with onions on them." (crowd oh-ing) (inhaling sharply) - Jaida. Was that the joke? Look over there! - To me, this was one of the most terrifying things that ever happened in my life, and sadly I just played that in front of y'all and y'all didn't even laugh at the (beep), but that's all right. (crowd laughing) I hope y'all had a great time. And that was the night that I put the P in Pageant. (crowd cheering) Thank you! Terrible. Terrible. Terrible. - [Announcer] And here's Jujubee. (crowd cheering) - Welcome to "RuPaul's Shady Shack." It's the grand opening, okay? And I want to say I am so happy to see all of you here. I see some new faces. I see some old faces. I see some new old faces. (crowd laughing) Work. No really, like lots and lots and lots of work. Shea, your lips. Michelle, your titties. And you over here, I know them shoulders are fake baby, you weren't born with those shoulders. Mm-hm. Ross, I am so glad you're here tonight. People don't know that you actually wrote a book. Oh, sorry, wait, wait, wait. Blair, so a book is a whole bunch of pages with words. Ross, you know I love you and I did try to buy your book online, and it basically said people who bought this book also searched for chardonnay, lip gloss, a life. (crowd laughing) Anyways, I notice that Gwyneth Paltrow wrote the intro to your book. Isn't it upsetting that the lady who could convince millions of women out there to stick stones in their pussy, still not be able to convince them to buy your book? (crowd laughing) (Ross laughing) - That's great. - I wish I had one blonde joke, but she's sitting over there. (crowd laughing) Now, I think I've been a little harsh tonight, but you know what? This ain't RuPaul Best Friend Race. Michelle already won that. - Thank you. (crowd laughing) - And Michelle, I think of you like I think of my mom. Resentfully. (crowd laughing) I'm Jujubee, good night! (funky music) (crowd cheering) - Woo! - Thank you. Jujubee, nice try. - Oh-ho-ho-ho. - Michelle Visage is here. I've been told by many that she's the first lady of Jersey, the very first, (crowd laughing) of all time. - Sounds right. (flipping page) - Now, I can't really make fun of age. I mean, people say all the time, "Blair, "you look so young!" But I am a grown, gay man and I do (beep) ass with the crust cut off. (crowd laughing) Now speaking of crusty assholes, Sam Richardson is here tonight everyone! (crowd laughing) - Hey. - That's all. And Jane Krakowski, it is so inspiring to have you with us tonight as well. You know, I just can't understand how you keep escaping from the old folks home. (crowd chuckling) (flipping pages) Ross is so important to this show. I mean, it only took 10 years of constant appearances for RuPaul to finally make him a permanent judge on the show. I mean, what, was tadra-kalt busy? (flipping page) I'm just kidding. I think what you do here is so valuable. I mean, every Destiny's Child needs its Michelle. And every judging panel needs that one person to make the guest judges feel just that much more famous! - Oh, I do declare this is a dumpster fire. - If you love me tonight, my name is Blair St. Clair. And if you hated me, it's Derrick Barry. (crowd clapping) - Oh my goodness! Hello! (crowd cheering) My name is Miz Cracker and I am so happy to see people. I don't know if you know this, but if you are a drag race contestant, they do not let you socialize like at all. They say this is like the Olympics of drag, no. This is like gay-tanamo bay. Please help me. (crowd laughing) Um. I am a New Yorker but like not in a mean way. Um. I am a Jew. So I get to say it that way. You do not. (crowd laughing) But most importantly I am a drag queen. I've been telling these girls from the beginning, like let's just be nice to each other tonight, but I guess I'm like Shea Coulee's music 'cause nobody listens to me. Do you know what I'm saying? (crowd laughing) There's this stereotype that drag queens have to be like beautiful in their makeup and glamorous and everything, but that is not necessarily true. Look at Juju, okay? Look at her. (crowd laughing) What was I saying? Oh, right, humility and love that's what it was. (crowd laughing) Also, I'm against body shaming, completely. Because I was a chubby kid and I know what body shaming can do to a person, you know? It works! Yeah! Ow! Ow! (crowd laughing) Obvious, everything you see is on sale! Yeah! Oh! Thank you everybody so much. (upbeat music) I appreciate you so much. (crowd cheering) - Hi everybody. How you doing tonight? (crowd cheering quietly) Oh, come on, you guys can do better than that. You had Miz Cracker's entire set to take a nap. (crowd laughing) Come on, so how you doin' tonight? (crowd cheering) Oh, that's so much better. Ladies and gentlemen, we've got the lovely Miss Blair St. Clair here. And, you guys, I don't wanna ruin too much, but she had a bit of a rough week last week. She failed her driver's test. (crowd laughing) Miz Cracker, make some noise for her. (crowd cheering) I love her. She's just so animated, larger than life. It's like she's a living, breathing puppet, you know? She's got this big head and these tiny little feet, and only becomes animated when you put your fist in her. (crowd laughing) Yeah. Yeah. Has anyone in here ever been robbed before? Well I have. And no I'm not talking about the finale of season 9. (crowd laughing) But for real, you know, it's been quite an interesting journey for me. Um. I've been going to therapy and for the longest time I thought that therapy was just for white people with money, and I was wrong. It is also for black people with money. (crowd laughing) But it's kind of embarrassing to tell your therapist that rose petals are one of your triggers, you know? For real, like rose petals have been following me around for the past three years like I'm James Earl Jones in "Coming to America." (crowd laughing) The only difference, he had a crown. (crowd laughing) Thank you so much. That's all the time I have for tonight. (crowd cheering) (upbeat music)- Hey all stars. - Hey. - So, a queen walks out of a bar and into the drag race hall of fame. But first, she's got to put her money where her funny is. (gasping) And I'm not joking, bitch. Where are the jokes? (bass beat) - Hello. (crowd clapping) Good evening ladies and gentlemen. Anybody else on their period? (crowd laughing) You know, I'm a little bit into the horror movies. Can you guess which one? "Carrie", yes. How many people have seen "Carrie" actually? Let's see. Good. Good. The real special thing about Carrie is that she has telekinetic powers. Telekinesis means that you can move things with your mind. The last time I moved anything with my head, it was in a motel room (crowd laughing) the John through $40 on my (beep) and told me to get the (beep) out. (crowd laughing) I was like I'm leaving, (beep) leaving. Good God. You ain't gotta yell at me like that. I'll see you at home dad. (crowd laughing) (upbeat music) - I'm a drag queen. When you first start doing drag it's like you want to be the fishiest, you want to have the best body, but now I want to be a fat girl. I want to be a fat girl. You can get (beep) from anywhere. Every guy wants to secretly (beep) a fat bitch, number one. So I'm not gonna have no man problems, okay? I want to be like really fat. I want to get pregnant and not even know it. (crowd laughing) Have you seen those specials on TV? And it's usually a big girl. It's like, of course she didn't know she was (beep) pregnant. (crowd laughing) You know what I mean? I want to go to the bathroom, sit on the toilet and become a mother. (crowd laughing) Okay? No matter what size I am, I will be the body beautiful. Always. Okay? Do you want to see? A little preview. (crowd cheering) And I will still (beep) turn it darling, always. (upbeat music) - Woo! (crowd cheering) Yes bitches! It is not Angelina Jolie. It is not Beyonce. It's your girl Alexis all the way from Puerto Rico. (yelling in Spanish) (crowd cheering) Honey. And I am so excited because I always wanted to be a star honey. So I left Puerto Rico behind and I moved to United States, all the way to Florida. I did travel in first class, right in front of that boat, baby. Honey, I'm a Latina girl and I only have two options in this country, being a housekeeper or being a stripper bitches. And y'all know I didn't came here to clean toilets, baby. So I became a stripper, baby! (crowd cheering) Yes ma'am, honey, if God gave it to you baby, you better make some money. (crowd laughing) Yes ma'am. I am here and I'm queer baby! (bass beat) - Mm-hm. I said bitch better have my money. Right? Let me tell you something baby, they call me Laqueefa. Laqueefa the P and P. Now that stands for the postmodern pimp-ho. (crowd laughing) Postmodern pimp-ho means yes I'm still a pimp, but I'm also my own ho. (crowd laughing) That's right. 'Cause of the recession y'all, I'm telling you, I done have to scale back, you know? And sometimes I don't even pay myself my own money. (crowd laughing) Uh-huh. If I did maybe I could get some shoes so my toes weren't hanging five inches off the edge. (crowd laughing) Yeah. I know you trying to clown me for my cliffhangers. Yeah. I saw it. You know, and they always trying to clown me on the block, baby. They always saying "Laqueefa!" I say "What?" (crowd laughing) They say "Laqueefa, where your ho's at?" I said, "Bitch, don't you see "I'm wearing four pair of hose right here "holding back my (beep)?" (crowd laughing) You know, I had a dumb-ass girlfriend that went and joined PETA. She came screaming at me last week, talking like "Laqueefa!" I said "What?" (crowd laughing) She said "Laqueefa, don't you know "how many innocent animals had to die "for you to have that fur coat?" I said "Bitch, "do you know how many rich animals "I had to (beep) to get this coat?" (crowd laughing) Stupid bitch! (upbeat music) (crowd cheering) - Hi everyone. My parents weren't really big about the TV. I really only had like PBS and "Sesame Street." "Sesame Street" was one gay-ass block. (crowd laughing) Okay, obviously we have Bert and Ernie, I mean they're so gay they practically are board members of "GLAD." Um. Now, one of my favorite people that lives on Sesame Street is the Count. He's one of those old, Liberace gays. And he loves collecting chachkies like Faberge eggs. One Faberge egg. Two Faberge egg. Three Faberge egg. Ah-ah-ah. (crowd laughing) (upbeat Latin American music) (crowd cheering) (crowd laughing) (crowd cheering) - Hi. I'm Yara Sofia. I'm gonna make a long story short. I met a guy in a club and he took me to a wonder restaurant he called McDonald's. (crowd laughing) "Do you want a chicken sandwich?" What the heck is chicken? She told me "Chicken means polla." Polla means (beep) in Spain! (crowd laughing) I said "I don't want to eat a (beep) sandwich." After that he took me to the apartment and he took her clothes off. Oh my god, what the hell is that? It was huge. The difference between an onion and a 14-inch (beep), both maked me cry. (crowd laughing) (crowd cheering) (fart sound) Get out! Get out! Get out! Get out! Get out! Get out! Get out! Get out! There was (beep) all over the bed. I felt like Willie Wonka's chocolate factory! (RuPaul laughing) (upbeat music) (crowd cheering) - My name's Delta Work. I'm in my early to, early 30's. And I'm here in Southern California just kind of looking for love, you know? And it's kind of hard for a big girl like me because it's so body conscious in L.A. and it freaks me out to think who is gonna want a girl like me? (crowd laughing) What? Is that funny? (crowd laughing) Like I see these stories about these girls, they go out running and then they get like abducted and assaulted and you know it's like I have to eat frozen burritos. I have to watch the marathon of "Hoarders." Because if I go out and exercise, I'm gonna get raped. (crowd laughing) You guys have been an amazing audience, thank you so much for coming out. We appreciate you coming out. (crowd cheering) (bass beat) (upbeat music) (crowd cheering) - Hey! (crowd cheering) My name is Miss Darienne Lake. I like to say miss 'cause it lets the boys know I'm single. (crowd laughing) You know? Of course my 14 cats and my appearance on "Hoarders, Buried Alive" might also let them know I'm single. (crowd laughing) I asked my mother, I'm like "Mom, "how did I end up so twisted? "Like did you like drop me on my head when I was a baby?" She was like "Honey, you have to be held to be dropped." (crowd laughing) I am here representing all the big and curvy girls. - Hey. (crowd clapping) - I'm trying to get in shape. I mean, well round is a shape, you know? - [Crowd Member] Yes, it is. - At the gym, I'm like a ninja. You will never see me there. (crowd laughing) I know we got some old people here in the audience tonight. Yes, how y'all doing? Yeah, did you guys all come together on the ark? (crowd laughing) Tell Noah I say "Hello." (crowd laughing) - As you may have all gathered from my accent, I am from Idaho. (crowd laughing) I'm kidding. I'm from Australia. Land of kangaroos, land of Olivia Newton-John, and "throw another shrimp on the barbie." - Yeah. - Well, what if I don't want shrimp thrown on me? (crowd laughing) I want to look fishy, not smell fishy. All right? (crowd laughing) So, I moved to America recently. I moved to West Hollywood. And I've written a little bit of a song about some of the people that I've met there and I'd like to sing it for you now. ♪ They'll take you down with just one look ♪ ♪ They hunt in packs, they don't read books ♪ ♪ Injectable tans and old tattoos ♪ ♪ Too young for Botox, got nothing to lose ♪ ♪ They're the mean gays, they live in West Hollywood ♪ ♪ They're the mean gays ♪ ♪ They'll take your wood if they could ♪ ♪ I'm a mean gay ♪ ♪ Well you would if you could ♪ ♪ I might look nice but do think twice ♪ ♪ Before you take me on ♪ (crowd clapping) (upbeat music) Thank you. - Hi. You're probably wondering why I look like a Mexican Katy Perry right now aren't you? My mother is a chola. Do you guys know what a chola is? Can I get a show of hands? Yeah, we're in L.A. mother-(beep). Yeah. (man laughing) My mom's a chola and she likes big (beep). Okay. No, yeah. I was really scared when I heard that senior citizens were gonna be in the (beep) audience tonight, okay? Just blame my (beep) grandma because she likes to go to TJ and get work done so I never grasped the concept to respect my elders. The bitch never ages. She has a fake ass and a fake hip, and I'm pretty sure the ass came first and broke the hip so I don't know what the hell she's doing. But anyways, my grandma's a whore. No? Okay cool. It's my first time people. (laughing nervously) You guys having fun? (crowd cheering) - Yeah. (upbeat music) - I'll mow your lawns later. - My name is BenDeLaCreme, hold for applause. Okay. And I'm delighted to be here with a live audience. I love it when there's people just right in front of me and I can feel like I could just reach right out and touch you if I wanted to. I don't want to, don't worry about that. But I feel like I could if I wanted to which is a great option to have. I'm far away from my hometown of Seattle, Washington. It's the city that never dries, but you know its rain is not so bad. It is a moist area, but it's my moist area and I love it. A lot of people come there you just need to wear the right protection, you know? There's a lot of stereotypes about Seattleites, but they're really just regular folk. Extremely regular folk. You know, caffeine, all in line for the restroom. We love a good rest. But, um, but, I digress. The point is I feel like I've learned to sort of weave a story, bring somebody on an arc that really ends somewhere, where they feel like the whole thing's been meaningful and they're gonna wind up with something that made the whole thing worthwhile. - [Man In Crowd] So tell us a joke. (bass note) - Good night everybody. - [Michelle] Wow. (upbeat music) (crowd clapping) - Hey, hey, hey, hey! Put your lighters up! Ganja's in the house! Yeah-ow! As you can tell from my accent, I am from Dallas, Tex-ass. And it was not very easy growing up looking like this. Whether I was playing in my grandma's clothes or putting on a show for my well-organized, alphabetically ordered beanie-babies, I was gug-guh-guh-gay. Okay? But it wasn't until I moved to Los Angeles that I discovered marijuana. I mean I like to smoke. Y'all I am just flying as high as your receding hairline, okay? (crowd groaning) Marijuana really does help me calm down. So y'all, I went to Valencia where they filmed the TV show "Weeds." Now, y'all, it's very dry. It's almost kind of like your vagina. (crowd groaning) Can I get an amen? Now y'all, I am a tree-hugger because if it ain't green, ha, I'm not interested, okay? (scattered clapping) (upbeat music) - Get up and show me some love. Come on. Get up. Show me some love. Get up. I got an honest (beep). Honest track. This stuff is hot. (crowd clapping) Thank you. Thank you. This ain't easy. I am not a comedian so go ahead sit down. Sit down. Sit down. Sit down. (beep) (beep) Sit down. (laughing) So if you all have not already noticed, I am black. But don't be worried, you know, you don't have to hold onto your purses and your wallets, I already got 'em. (crowd laughing) Growing up for me was really hard because we were really poor. We were like "Good Times" poor. It was really, really gay. (RuPaul laughing) And um, the only way we had the opportunity to eat was my mother would read us recipes from a cook book. (crowd laughing) And oh how I got full many nights off of the roast beef on page 27. (crowd laughing) But a really unfortunate thing happened, my sister caught an ear infection so she starved to death. (crowd laughing) I really grew up a lot with my grandmother. I stayed at my grandmother's house, one, because she was just a sweet lady and two, because she had food. (crowd laughing) But, she had this really crazy obsession with her bills. And it was the light bill in particular. Everything involved the light bill. Stop running around my house like that, you're gonna run my light bill up. (crowd laughing) Stop flushing that toilet so much, you're gonna run my damn light bill up. (crowd laughing) Stop breathing so much, you're gonna run my light bill up. I just feel like I can be myself and just let my hair down with all of you people. - [Crowd Member] Whoa! (crowd laughing) - Good time. It's a party. It's a party! (crowd cheering) Yes! - You know, I've suffered from ADHD all of my life. It's a constant struggle every day. (crowd aww-ing) Ooh look, a rhinestone (giggling). (crowd laughing) But I'm always getting (beep) you know. "Oh, you're so skinny why don't you just eat something." Or "Eat a cheeseburger you skinny bitch." And all I want to say is "Well then give me something to eat, "I'm (beep) starving!" So I've got a little theory going here. Ever since I've come to the show and I've met RuPaul, I have a little theory here. I'm gonna run it by you. I've seen RuPaul in the work room out of drag. I see RuPaul here on the runway as a drag queen. Never in the same room at the same time. Both RuPaul's, same person. Pretty sure I cracked the code. (funky music) Just saying. (crowd cheering) - I am so excited to see the cast of "Cocoon" is here. (crowd laughing) You look fabulous! Miss! I'm over here. Bring both eyes. I'm right here! (crowd laughing) Damn, Pearl Harbor must've did ya in. (crowd laughing) On a lighter note, I'd like to let you know about my family. My mother is from Cuba and my dad is from Honduras, which basically means I have a large (beep), no credit, and a tendency to take things that don't belong to me. (crowd laughing) My mother insisted that we stay true to our Spanish heritage so my first words were "(knocking) house keeping." (crowd laughing) I like the gentleman in back who's sleeping, makes me feel right at home. Can you wake that bitch up? Yeah, the one right there with the horizontal stripes. Not a good look in your 3rd trimester sir, all right? (crowd laughing) All I've ever heard from the judges was that we need to see more versatility, and you know what I gotta say to y'all is that I will show you versatility when Santino wins a sewing competition and Visage wears a (beep) turtleneck. (crowd laughing) Ain't gonna happen! (crowd laughing) Well I gotta say I hope you guys had a lot of fun. And because I'm feeling extra special, I'm gonna put fresh tennis balls on every walker in the place. (crowd laughing) Jello, all around! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Mwah! (crowd cheering) (upbeat music) - [Announcer] Our hostesses with the mostesses, Mrs. Kasha Davis and Katya. (crowd clapping) - Oh my goodness everyone. We want to welcome you to the first annual Despy Awards. Now Katya, what in the hell does "Despy" stand for? - Well judging from the looks of the nominees, I'm gonna go with desperate, egotistical, sluts prancing in the yard. (RuPaul laughing) (crowd cheering) - [Kasha] Got it! - The talented Ginger Minj is here tonight or as I like to refer to her "the Danny DeVito of drag." (crowd laughing) - And we have in our presence Miss lame, shame, pain. - Whatever. - Whatever. - The gorgeous Pearl. The drag equivalent of a Valium taking a Xanax in a K-hole. (judges laughing) - And last but not least. - As usual. - We have - Violet. - Violet. (Violet laughing) (crowd laughing) - Please welcome to the stage the stars of Tyler Perry's "Roots", Kennedy Davenport and Miss Jaidynn Diore Fierce. (RuPaul laughing) (crowd clapping) - Hello everyone. Straight from Kunta Kinte's hut. (crowd laughing) The hourglass and the wall clock. (crowd laughing) - Hold on. Who's the wall clock? - Step over there. - Okay. - Do this. - Okay. - My point. (crowd laughing) - [Jaidynn] Anyways, we are here to present this award for the sexy, sexy drag queen. - Let us announce these awful nominees. Kandy Ho! - And we all know how she got that last name. - In the back alley honey. - Whore. (crowd laughing) Miss Fame. - Oh, the brand. Since when did the dollar store become a brand? (crowd laughing) - And Max. Girl, ain't that the queen from that movie "Powder?" (crowd laughing) - The winner is - Girl. (drum roll) - Miss Fame! (brass music) (crowd cheering) - I wish I could cry but goddamn Botox got me every time. Other than that I'd like to thank Mexico for the tapeworm that snatched my body. And the man upstairs, thank you so much for the light. I look great! (crowd laughing) Thank you so much! - [Announcer] Next up. Pearl and Max. - It is a true honor to be presenting the Despy Award for most busted drag queen. What is a busted drag queen? I'm glad you asked. - Oh yes. The nominees are Mrs. Potato, I mean Miss Jaidynn Diore Fierce. (crowd laughing) - Miss Ginger Minj. Girl. After we swing on by gator land, we can get on back to my apartment and swing on my husband. (crowd laughing) The Brooke Hogan of drag, Katya. (crowd laughing) - And last but certainly not youngest, Mrs. Kasha Davis. (crowd laughing) - Did you hear that dear? (RuPaul laughing) And the winner is (drum roll) (gasping) - Jaidynn Diore Fierce! (brass music) (crowd cheering) - Thank you to all my fellow horrible drag queens. I hope you all burn in hell. (RuPaul laughing) And I mean it. (crowd cheering) - [Announcer] Next up, Ginger Minj and Kandy Ho. - I am so honored to be here at the first annual Despy Awards. - And I'm working off community service. (crowd laughing) - We've gathered the very best to present the award for the shadiest shade. (Ginger gasping) - Congratulations Kandy! Oh, I think it's high time that your beard gets the public recognition it deserves. (crowd laughing) - No, no Ginger. This award is for that girl who knows how to throw the shade and not apply it. - And the nominees are - the girl who puts the fun in ele-funt, Ginger Minj. (crowd laughing) - The, how do I say this and remain socially responsible? "Black horse" of the competition, Kennedy Davenport. (crowd laughing) - And last, as usual, Violet Chachki! And the award goes to Violet Chachki! (brass music) (crowd cheering) - You don't like me. You really don't like me! And last but not least, God, thanks. (RuPaul laughing) (crowd clapping) - Next up, Miss Fame and Violet Chachki. - Are there any married couples in the house? Michelle Visage, how long? - 17 years. - Ooh girl, no, how long? (crowd laughing) - As someone who is highly experienced with handling meat, I cannot wait to hear the nominees for meatiest tuck. - Oh, so you work in meat packing? - [Violet] You could say that. - Oh. - Then let's go ahead and receive the nominees. - [Fame] Katya, VIP. - Very impressive package. Jaidynn Diore Fierce. - Hey girl! - Meatiest tuck? Girl, let's be honest, looks like she smuggled a honey-baked ham in her panties. (crowd laughing) That brings us to our last nominee. Pearl. - Pearl. - Pearl's tucking ability is just like her personality, semi-precious, exhausted, and barely there. (crowd laughing) And the Despy Award goes to Katya! (brass music) (crowd cheering) - I believe it was the great American painter Bob Ross who said (RuPaul laughing) "The key to a swollen vagina is courage." (RuPaul laughing) (crowd cheering) - Have a good night everyone. Thank you so much. (crowd cheering) (crowd cheering) (upbeat music) - Hi everybody! Well I'm gonna be your hostess and MC. I'm just gonna start off with saying I'm sorry. (crowd laughing) So um, how many of y'all saw season 5? Season 5, "RuPaul's Drag Race?" (crowd cheering) You saw the roast? Yeah, I suck. I suck more than Michelle Visage at a truck stop with a glory hole, right? So listen, I'm here, you know, just struggling, another thing I struggle with is my weight. Anybody struggle with weight? - Woo! - Yeah, girl. I mean I just don't know how to get rid of those extra pounds. And these damn airports, you know, the bags can only be 50 pounds and it costs a lot of money to look this cheap, you know? But I'm so excited, are y'all ready for some real comedy? - [Crowd] Yeah! - 'Cause I'm dying up here ladies and gentlemen. Now, I'm not the funniest. (crowd laughing) - You killed that one sis! (crowd laughing) - First up out of the gate, besides myself, is these two girls. One thing that they do love is the color orange. Coco Montrese and Phi Phi O'Hara! (crowd cheering) (funky music) - Woo! Hey daddy. - Oh my God, Cocita, there you are! (crowd laughing) How's everything out here on the strip tonight? - Oh girl it ain't going to good honey. The last john I sat on, woof, I had Mexican food, it wasn't that good. - Man, I'm so sorry to hear that, but I have a little favor to ask of you. - What you want girl? - Think you could do my makeup? - Sit down. I got my good stuff. - Oh my God I'm so excited. You know every time I'm on like your social medias and stuff. - Mm-hm. - I'm always looking at your pictures and I'm like oh my God, no filters. - Mm-hm. (crowd laughing) - Okay, well first tell me what is the first step in this, you know, Cocita makeup tutorial? - First, you gotta take that bag of cheesy chips girl. - Okay. Okay. (crowd laughing) - Crush it up real good. - Okay. Okay. - Then you gotta, you gotta just take it and beat that face. - Oh, oh. - I mean girl you got to beat it, beat it like you stole something. (crowd laughing) So what's this audition for anyway? - Well I'm gonna be an actress. - Girl, I hope it's not a musical. You know any instrument you play you gotta blow. - That's not true mama, I've been writing a lot of stuff. ♪ Jump in a car ♪ ♪ And jump out ♪ ♪ The cops are coming, put the hands on the hood ♪ - Girl, hold on. Hold on. Hold on girl. I got something for you. - Oh, what's this? - I got you a key. - A key? - 'Cause you can't seem to find one girl. (funky music) - [Katya] Coco and Phi Phi are not so much doing a comedy routine, but a live-action off, off, off, off Broadway theater production of "Hookers at the Point." (crowd cheering) - Hey there! What seems to be going on? (crowd cheering) (judges laughing) So Rocky was bombing up here, so yeah, she asked me to come and finish the show for her. You don't wanna see anymore of her, right? My name is Tasha Salad. I was on season 5 of "Rupaul's Drag Race." Do you remember? I'm so excited to be here. I just got off the best Italian vacation. I was over in the beautiful Thousand Island on a beautiful ranch. And let me tell you, I flew in just to try and save her ass. Are you ready for some more comedy? Are you ready? Are you ready? Are you ready? (crowd cheering) Ladies and gentlemen, she is the blue cheese to the other one's crumbles. (crowd laughing) Make some noise, this is Alyssa Edwards and Alaska! (upbeat music) (crowd cheering) - My name is Alaska, just like the state. - My name is Alyssa Edwards. - Yes. - And this definitely ain't nobody's secret, that this gigorama is completely full of buffoonery, (crowd laughing) rigory, (crowd laughing) and straight up tomfoolery. (crowd laughing) - Totally. (crowd laughing) Alyssa, we're in the company of some amazing queens tonight. - Where? (crowd laughing) - Ouch. (crowd laughing) Detox and Tatianna are here. - The heels have eyes part two, the remix. (crowd laughing) - Bam. (crowd laughing) Alyssa, describe Michelle Visage in one word. Go. (drum roll) - Beast! (crowd laughing) - Burn. (crowd laughing) Alyssa, I want to thank you so much for being my partner tonight. Don't worry, if drag doesn't work out, you'll always have something to fall back on. Your back rolls. (crowd laughing) - These next two girls, let me tell you, they are so nutty. Besides walnuts and almonds, these are my favorite nuts ladies and gentlemen. Make some noise! This is Ginger Minj and Katya! (crowd cheering) (upbeat music) - It's not the first time she's gotten clap from a room full of people. (crowd laughing) Well hey y'all! How are you? You know I'm so excited to be here tonight, sharing the stage with my BFF, Katya! (crowd cheering) Now I know most of you might be sitting out there asking yourself "Self", that's what you say, you say "Self, "now how does a delicate, petite, "little cross dresser for Christ "become best friends with a disease-riddled, "low-rent, Russian whore?" (crowd laughing) - You see I spend most of my time on my back while she tries to find someone to shave hers. (crowd laughing) - It's funny 'cause it's true (laughing). Seriously, this one right here has more fish than an all you can eat seafood buffet. - That's funny Ginger. I'm sure you know all about the buffet, you know because you're fat. (crowd laughing) - Shut up. I will turn you into immigration, balky. All right? (crowd laughing) - But through it all, we have plunged head-first into the most beautiful friendship and we have never looked back. Mostly because she doesn't have a neck and she can't really turn her head. (crowd laughing) Thank you all so much. Good night! - No, bitch, get back here! I got asthma but I will catch you. (crowd laughing) - Ladies and gentlemen, do I look a little slimmer to you? Like I lost some weight? Do you wanna know my secret? I started using light dressing. (scattered clapping) Get it? - [Drag Queen] We got it girl. We got it. - Okay, next up, well one of these girls, she is so fishy. She is the sardines in Caesar dressing. The other girl prefers un-cut carrots in her salad. Make some noise! This is Detox and Tatianna! (upbeat music) (crowd cheering) - Hey! Hello! Hello! Hello! My name is Lydia Ladybits. - And I'm Beatrice Backdoor. (crowd laughing) Thank y'all so much for coming to tonight's event. It's a benefit for Babies Battling Bulimia. (crowd laughing) - But I already see there's a bevy of beautiful, bitter bitches already here hitting the buffet. (crowd laughing) Be and I met last year at Patty's Pooches with Prolapse garden party. We did. - Oh my God. - The rosebuds were in full bloom. - The assholes were out, literally. (crowd laughing) Especially this one's date. - Date? I came alone. - You came with Carlos the gardener! (crowd laughing) Well, what? You were blowing saliva water balloons. (crowd laughing) And all you guys are here, giving your time and your money to this lovely benefit for teeny-tiny, teeny-tiny tots. But I just want to know when you're gonna have some teeny-tiny tots of your own their Be? - I've always wanted some. My doctor keeps telling me that my test, that my ovaries are just getting in the way. (crowd laughing) You know, I've always wanted to tell you something. There's a secret behind the woman that you see here today. - Oh no, is there really? - Oh this is hard for me to say. - It's okay dar, spit it out. No matter what you're about to tell me, you will always be in my eyes, my best girl friend. (crowd laughing) - You see, I used to have braces. (crowd laughing) - Oh Be! You are incredible Be! We'll see you next year. Oh, oh no. That Sally Field, that (beep) lied to me about the Boniva. - Come on. - Let's do it. (crowd cheering) - Ladies and gentlemen, the joy is on the show, say yeah! (crowd cheering) We want to thank you guys for coming out tonight. And if you can't laugh at yourself, how in the hell are you gonna laugh at somebody else? Can I get an amen? - [Crowd] Amen! - Good night! (upbeat music) - Michelle, is that Dahlia? - Yes. She's stalking us. - Oh. The Big Pink Furry Box Theater presents "Jackie Cox: Between Two Parents." (crowd cheering) - Hello! Hello! Now it may be hard to believe from what you see in front of you, but both of my parents are scientists. (crowd laughing) my father is a mild-mannered Canadian with a very dry sense of humor. My mother is from Iran and like many immigrant parents, had a very clear list of things that she wanted me to accomplish to fulfill her dreams. Top of which is become a doctor. And nowhere on this list (crowd laughing) was drag queen. Bouncing between these two households, my parents clearly did not stay married, was something that challenged me in many different ways. Take my mother for instance, I'm maybe 12 years old, watching the TV. (crowd laughing) - What is this? (crowd laughing) I do not approve of these Spice Girls. This is too sexy-mexy. Go to your room and go study your book on male anatomy. Well you don't have to tell me twice. (crowd laughing) So I hear you are interested in performing and music and dancing. I believe in you. Okay, first things first, we're gonna start with ballet and then jazz and then tap and then all of the dancing starting from Flamenco to Salsa. Dad, this is a lot. I don't know if that's what I want to do. But a few years later I started to get a little bit of an idea. Me and a few friends sneak out and we drive down to Chicago Gay Pride. And that's when I see them for the first time. They look eight feet tall, giant high heels, giant hair. These aren't just women, these are drag queens. And I am mesmerized. (crowd clapping) I decide to take home a little souvenir. A beautiful white feather boa with sparkly parts in it too. I get home, sneak that boa, hide it up in the top-most corner of my closet. (crowd laughing) What is this? (crowd laughing) If my mom can get past the fact that I'm a drag queen on national television, hopefully she'll get over this impression of her. And what have I figured out? Having someone in your corner who is always cheering you on and believes in you, that's love. And I learned that having someone who always wants to make sure that nothing bad will ever happen to you, that's real love. And I also learned to hide that feather boa a little better. (crowd laughing) (crowd cheering) Thank you guys! (crowd cheering) (upbeat music) - I'm a little worried having to follow this act because she definitely put a lot of herself and her heart in it, and I'm not playing myself at all. - Next, Crystal Methyd in "Phenomenal Phil, Exotic Dance Instructor." (dance music) (crowd cheering) - Thank you, thank you! How we doing tonight ladies? (crowd cheering) (judges laughing) All right, well I'm Phenomenal Phil, exotic dance instructor to the stars. (RuPaul laughing) I worked with Channing Tatum. I taught him how to do "the worm." (crowd laughing) I've also taught Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson how to do "the sprinkler." (crowd cheering) (RuPaul laughing) I even taught Betty White how to do "the jerk." (crowd cheering) (judges laughing) Are y'all ready to start feeling yourself? (crowd cheering) I brought you moves from my dance training DVD "Fill Me Up." (Whoopi laughing) (crowd cheering) This first move is "the litter box." But (crowd laughing) get yourself in the mind of a pussycat. And then you gotta get that soiled sand like out of here! Get it out! (crowd laughing) And then we're gonna dump it, okay? (crowd oh-ing) Get it out! (crowd laughing) Fill her up! We're not done yet. But we probably got some on our legs, so give a little bit of this, (crowd laughing) a little of that. - All right, Crystal. She's killing it out here. (crowd woo-ing) You might have to change your name to Phenomenal Phil after this performance. - This is my big money maker. It's "the Brazilian banana inspector." (crowd ooh-ing) Start up and just find the banana in the tree. I think they grow on trees. (crowd laughing) Pull it down and then you gotta make sure you work the nips on the way down. So (mumbling). (crowd laughing) And a little bit of that! And then we work it down to the hips. (crowd cheering) (RuPaul laughing) All right everybody. I think that's about all the time I have for today. I'll be in the back selling my DVD but only for about 20 minutes because I'm performing at a bar mitzvah later! (crowd laughing) (upbeat music) Thank you! (crowd cheering) - Up next, Heidi Aphrodite in "Cookout With Your Cheeks Out." - Ooh, y'all look so good! Y'all look so good. I really just want to give y'all some of my hometown livin'. The first member of my family I want you to meet is my grandmother. She's the one who raised me and she really hates everyone. (crowd laughing) Let me introduce you to grandmother. 'Bout time all y'all got here in my house! Now y'all best stop opening up my door and stuff. I don't pay to air-condition the outside. Oh Lord have mercy here comes Sharon with that nasty-ass potato salad. Oh Lord. (crowd laughing) Hello. Hello, how are you all doing? I brought the potato salad. Don't worry, I'm a put it right here in the middle. Now Sharon, I done told you about that potato salad. You don't season it. You don't put the right potatoes in it. You don't even put mustard in it. (gasping) How dare you talk about my potato salad! And there's always Uncle Rob, the drunk. (crowd laughing) Why y'all... (hiccuping) (crowd lady laughing) Why y'all fightin'? Rob, I done told you, take your drunk-ass and sit down somewhere, always in somebody's business. The party don't start 'til cousin Slick walks in. Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo wassup? (mumbling gibberish) Wassup, wassup, wassup yo. Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo. Yo what's here to eat? Aunt Sharon says "You know, it's my potato salad here. "You know, it's so good." No, no, no Aunt Sharon. No, no, no. You know the last time I had your potato salad (laughing) I had to blow that bathroom up! (crowd laughing) Dumb-ass. (crowd laughing) Just you wait and see Sharon. I'm gonna laugh right in your face. - Heidi is not giving what I expected from Heidi. - Yo, yo, yo, I gotta go. Bye, bye, bye, bye. - Baby, the ship is, it's not sinking but there's a few holes in it. - Have a good night everybody. (crowd cheering) - The Furry Box Theater presents Gigi Goode in "Welcome Aboard Brimstone Airways." (crowd cheering) (upbeat music) - Good morning sinners. Welcome aboard Brimstone Airways flight 666, non-stop to hell. (crowd laughing) Right, you all did something in your lives to piss off the big guy upstairs. I'm gonna let you know why a couple of you are here, all right? Let's see. You. You in the front row in this ripped-up denim jacket, what's your name? - Derek. - Gary, nice to meet you Gary. (crowd laughing) Gary. Your credit score sucks Gary. (crowd laughing) You. What's your name? - Morgan. - I'm gonna call you Karen from now on. Is that okay? (crowd laughing) I'm gonna tell you why you're on your way to hell Karen, it's because you're a goddamn hippocrite. (crowd laughing) All right? I see you mixing textiles. (crowd oh-ing) He's paying attention. (crowd laughing) Give me one second. I'm gonna gather my extremely important tools. (opening drawer) All right. If you'll kindly familiarize yourself with the lack of exits on this aircraft. You look to my left and right, that's right, no exits here. (crowd laughing) Okay? For your in-flight snacks we have just one option. It's peanuts. (crowd ah-ing) Unsalted peanuts. (crowd laughing) Welcome to hell, bitch. (crowd laughing) Okay, let's see where I'm at now. All right. So. - I love Gigi's concept but I'm seeing Gigi kind of trying to remember her outline and keep going back to it when she's on a roll on different jokes. - Okay. All right. So, when we do land, something will magically open, then you'll get off and immediately engulfed in flames. So as stated before, that tiny piece of fabric with metal attached to it is not gonna protect you from (beep) Karen. (crowd laughing) Or you Gary. (crowd laughing) I see you're wearing distressed denim, it's 2020. (crowd laughing) Let's keep that in mind. All right, I've just received word from the captain that we are beginning our initial decent. On behalf of Brimstone Airways, I want to thank you for choosing us as your means of transportation today. And please, enjoy your stay in Detroit. (crowd laughing) Thank you. Burn in hell. Thank you. Go (beep) yourself Gary. (crowd laughing) - Up next, Jaida Essence Hall in "The P in Pageant." (upbeat music) (crowd cheering) - Hey blow bitches, my name is Jaida Essence Hall, and for those of you who do not know me, I am a drag queen and a badass bitch, okay? (crowd cheering) And for those of you who do know me, I am sorry. (RuPaul laughing) I'm a take you all on a tour of one of the worst experiences that has ever happened to me in my life. Now one time I was hired to judge and perform at a pageant. The girls are beautiful. They're walking around in these beautiful gowns, and I get a little shake in my right leg. Child, ooh. So I look over for a familiar face. Hey Rue! Except Rue happens to be my boyfriend. He comes on over. I'm in a situation, I'm a need a little bit of help, okay? The category is over, I push the chair back, I start to run. Baby, I have to piss. Tap him on the shoulder. Run into the bathroom. (footsteps) Ooh, y'all are not feeling it. That's (mumbling). (crowd laughing) That's all right, we're going on a journey. Okay. And I'm like okay baby. Help me out here. I'm pulling up my dress. He's all on the floor. He's fumbling around. I'm like baby come on, come on, come on, come on, come on! And then I stop. (peeing sound effect) - [Man In Crowd] Uh-oh. (peeing sound effect) (crowd laughing) - All I can do is look down at my man on the floor, (crowd laughing) looking up at me, covered in urine. I head back to the judges table, the head judge says "Please, please, please "can we get some air freshener over here?" (crowd oh-ing) - Oh no. - But then he looks over and says "These other judges to the left, "they have hot dogs with onions on them." (crowd oh-ing) (inhaling sharply) - Jaida. Was that the joke? Look over there! - To me, this was one of the most terrifying things that ever happened in my life, and sadly I just played that in front of y'all and y'all didn't even laugh at the (beep), but that's all right. (crowd laughing) I hope y'all had a great time. And that was the night that I put the P in Pageant. (crowd cheering) Thank you! Terrible. Terrible. Terrible. - [Announcer] And here's Jujubee. (crowd cheering) - Welcome to "RuPaul's Shady Shack." It's the grand opening, okay? And I want to say I am so happy to see all of you here. I see some new faces. I see some old faces. I see some new old faces. (crowd laughing) Work. No really, like lots and lots and lots of work. Shea, your lips. Michelle, your titties. And you over here, I know them shoulders are fake baby, you weren't born with those shoulders. Mm-hm. Ross, I am so glad you're here tonight. People don't know that you actually wrote a book. Oh, sorry, wait, wait, wait. Blair, so a book is a whole bunch of pages with words. Ross, you know I love you and I did try to buy your book online, and it basically said people who bought this book also searched for chardonnay, lip gloss, a life. (crowd laughing) Anyways, I notice that Gwyneth Paltrow wrote the intro to your book. Isn't it upsetting that the lady who could convince millions of women out there to stick stones in their pussy, still not be able to convince them to buy your book? (crowd laughing) (Ross laughing) - That's great. - I wish I had one blonde joke, but she's sitting over there. (crowd laughing) Now, I think I've been a little harsh tonight, but you know what? This ain't RuPaul Best Friend Race. Michelle already won that. - Thank you. (crowd laughing) - And Michelle, I think of you like I think of my mom. Resentfully. (crowd laughing) I'm Jujubee, good night! (funky music) (crowd cheering) - Woo! - Thank you. Jujubee, nice try. - Oh-ho-ho-ho. - Michelle Visage is here. I've been told by many that she's the first lady of Jersey, the very first, (crowd laughing) of all time. - Sounds right. (flipping page) - Now, I can't really make fun of age. I mean, people say all the time, "Blair, "you look so young!" But I am a grown, gay man and I do (beep) ass with the crust cut off. (crowd laughing) Now speaking of crusty assholes, Sam Richardson is here tonight everyone! (crowd laughing) - Hey. - That's all. And Jane Krakowski, it is so inspiring to have you with us tonight as well. You know, I just can't understand how you keep escaping from the old folks home. (crowd chuckling) (flipping pages) Ross is so important to this show. I mean, it only took 10 years of constant appearances for RuPaul to finally make him a permanent judge on the show. I mean, what, was tadra-kalt busy? (flipping page) I'm just kidding. I think what you do here is so valuable. I mean, every Destiny's Child needs its Michelle. And every judging panel needs that one person to make the guest judges feel just that much more famous! - Oh, I do declare this is a dumpster fire. - If you love me tonight, my name is Blair St. Clair. And if you hated me, it's Derrick Barry. (crowd clapping) - Oh my goodness! Hello! (crowd cheering) My name is Miz Cracker and I am so happy to see people. I don't know if you know this, but if you are a drag race contestant, they do not let you socialize like at all. They say this is like the Olympics of drag, no. This is like gay-tanamo bay. Please help me. (crowd laughing) Um. I am a New Yorker but like not in a mean way. Um. I am a Jew. So I get to say it that way. You do not. (crowd laughing) But most importantly I am a drag queen. I've been telling these girls from the beginning, like let's just be nice to each other tonight, but I guess I'm like Shea Coulee's music 'cause nobody listens to me. Do you know what I'm saying? (crowd laughing) There's this stereotype that drag queens have to be like beautiful in their makeup and glamorous and everything, but that is not necessarily true. Look at Juju, okay? Look at her. (crowd laughing) What was I saying? Oh, right, humility and love that's what it was. (crowd laughing) Also, I'm against body shaming, completely. Because I was a chubby kid and I know what body shaming can do to a person, you know? It works! Yeah! Ow! Ow! (crowd laughing) Obvious, everything you see is on sale! Yeah! Oh! Thank you everybody so much. (upbeat music) I appreciate you so much. (crowd cheering) - Hi everybody. How you doing tonight? (crowd cheering quietly) Oh, come on, you guys can do better than that. You had Miz Cracker's entire set to take a nap. (crowd laughing) Come on, so how you doin' tonight? (crowd cheering) Oh, that's so much better. Ladies and gentlemen, we've got the lovely Miss Blair St. Clair here. And, you guys, I don't wanna ruin too much, but she had a bit of a rough week last week. She failed her driver's test. (crowd laughing) Miz Cracker, make some noise for her. (crowd cheering) I love her. She's just so animated, larger than life. It's like she's a living, breathing puppet, you know? She's got this big head and these tiny little feet, and only becomes animated when you put your fist in her. (crowd laughing) Yeah. Yeah. Has anyone in here ever been robbed before? Well I have. And no I'm not talking about the finale of season 9. (crowd laughing) But for real, you know, it's been quite an interesting journey for me. Um. I've been going to therapy and for the longest time I thought that therapy was just for white people with money, and I was wrong. It is also for black people with money. (crowd laughing) But it's kind of embarrassing to tell your therapist that rose petals are one of your triggers, you know? For real, like rose petals have been following me around for the past three years like I'm James Earl Jones in "Coming to America." (crowd laughing) The only difference, he had a crown. (crowd laughing) Thank you so much. That's all the time I have for tonight. (crowd cheering) (upbeat music)- Ladies, I must ask, which one of you should go home tonight and why? let's start with DeLa. - I think Darienne. Everyone else who's here has really shown an ability to hear critique and adjust, and some folks like Bianca just sail through. But Darienne, I think she frequently assumes she is doing better than people from an outside perspective might see. - All right, thanks, DeLa. Adore Delano. - I feel, based on this challenge, Darienne. - Bianca Del Rio. - If it's about this particular challenge, I would have to say Darienne, and you know I'm not gonna lie to you-- - I know. - Which is why I'm called a bitch, and apparently I'm sailing now. - Is that a bad thing? - Whatever, queen. I should pick your ass just for being a (bleep). - That was like, you're good at stuff. - No, that was very condescending. (chuckling) - I have to ask you each who should be eliminated tonight. Rebecca, what's your answer? - Do we just get to pick one? (laughing) - You could pick three. (laughing) - You know what? My three competitors are nice girls and I love 'em all, but some of them have already peaked at whatever they were gonna do drag-wise, and I should have the opportunity to progress and grow. - I hear you. But honestly, I really do need you to give me one name. - Out of the three, I would say Chanel. - Okay, and why's that? - She's a little annoying at times. - Thank you. All right, Nina, who should be eliminated tonight? - Rebecca. Why? Because America's next drag queen superstar should be someone with experience so that this person can take the title with dignity and respect. - All right, BeBe. Same question. - I would say Rebecca, because working with her is frustrating. And the rule, when it comes down to it, amongst all of us, I know Rebecca is at a lower level. That's what I have to say. - Thank you, Bebe. Chanel, who should be eliminated tonight? - I'm so glad you asked me this question. I nominate myself because I don't want to be here anymore. Since day one, I have been judged really hard and I'm very frustrated that you can't see the personality, because I am so (censored) real, you have no idea. And I don't feel that I am being understood here. I am beautiful. I'm a beautiful person internally and on the outside. And it's so, so frustrating to me that that image does not seem to be conveyed. Week after week, when we come into an elimination round, I am so negatively critiqued. - The truth is, you are beautiful. You are really beautiful. - Thank you. Thank you. - You are, you are. - That sounds so nice to hear. - It's true. And I'm sorry, I thought I told you earlier, I really did. I would not like you to leave. You are a great contender for this contest. - An answer to your question, I nominate myself. - Thank you, Chanel. You all worked so hard on this challenge, but I have to ask one question. Who deserves to go home tonight and why? Trinity Taylor. - Just from your critique, that would be Charlie. - Peppermint, same question. - Based on the critiques, Charlie. - Charlie Hides. - Peppermint's look is a bit more basic. So, Peppermint. - Cynthia Lee Fontaine. - Because I believe she's a strong competition for me, and her total look, Peppermint. - All right, Eureka, you're up. - I would say Trinity. I feel like the ending wrap-up might have been a little more controlled if we worked as a group, and I also felt like she was focused on herself and not really so much of everyone else. - I call shade. I take responsibility for the things that I did wrong. And if that's the reason why I should go home, then I understand. But don't tell me that I didn't do my job as a leader, because I did. And I included everybody, including you, Eureka. - Well, I was asked my honest opinion, and that's my honest opinion, and I stand beside it. - Alright, Nina. - Trinity, because she was the captain. But she did her job, it's just that we didn't really feel a part of this at times. - Who deserves to go home tonight and why? Starting with Eureka. - Oh gosh. Honestly, maybe Asia O'Hara because she's my biggest competition, to be honest. - Monet X Change. - Taking into account smash game and tonight's assignment, mermaid eleganza, I would have to say The Vixen. - Vixen. - I have never seen such a level of unprofessionalism as I have watching Eureka, and it baffles me that you guys enjoy her so much. It has really been very difficult working in an environment with her because she takes all the air out of the room. She's always the one who has to get the last word. - In my defense, I tell everyone all the time, I'm sorry that I'm loud and I'm sorry I'm too much. But also-- - But you don't try to stop being loud or try to stop being too much. You're like, "I'm sorry, but this is who I am. "Deal with it." - It's also a strength of mine when it comes to-- - Apparently. - The confidence in acting. - But what I've seen from Eureka is, "I'm the one who's getting all the attention in the room," which to me, is very childish. which, I guess, is why the characters that she played has worked for her because she's a child. - I'm sorry that she feels that way, but I will say one more thing. - Again, getting the last word. - I'm sorry, but I can't let her sit there-- - Again. - And literally verbally attack me. Yes, I do talk too much and I'm expressive and animated. - But everyone doesn't have to accept it. - But I'm also extremely kind and I'm full of love, because I know that sometimes, I am a lot to deal with, but I can't change that. And I try-- - You could try. - To be understanding of people, but I can't handle someone-- - You weren't attacked. You're a grown man. - Verbally attacking me in front of people that I want to have respect for my art, when I really have tried everything I can to be as kind as I can to Vixen. And that's all I'll say, I'm sorry. - All right, thank you, ladies. All right, Asia. - Because I'm an adult and although I've grown to love her and she's my sister, I think The Vixen has the most room for growth. - Monique. - I love her so much, but I would say The Vixen. Basing it solely on the challenge. She had the weakest character out of them all, and she has kind of just plateaued. - And what say you, Aquaria? - The Vixen with the way she's interpreted some of the challenges. - Alright, well, thank you, ladies. - [RuPaul] Morgan McMichaels. - [Morgan] Yes. - You have immunity. - Yes, ma'am. - Now in a minute, I'm gonna have to send someone home. Who should it be and why? (suspenseful music) - The weakest person in the group is Tatianna. - Tatianna, who do you think should go home today? - I'm just gonna go with Morgan because she has immunity. - Tatianna, that's an answer for the Miss America contest, not the RuPaul Drag Race contest. Nicole, same question. - Send them all home. - Send all these bitches home? Okay. (laughing) Send all these bitches home. - They eventually all have to go. So, I don't want to be the one to go, so send them all. - Raven, who would you send home tonight? - I would say Tatianna. I don't think she wants to be a grand superstar diva. I think she's comfortable being a beautiful girl. - No. (laughing) Not the case. If I was comfortable being a beautiful girl, I was a beautiful girl at home. That's not why I'm here, to be pretty. - Okay. - Thank you. - Just my opinion. - At this point in the competition, I have to ask the question. Who deserves to go home tonight and why? Kennedy Davenport. - I would have to say Fame, because clearly, the struggle is real. - [RuPaul] Katya. - I would probably say Fame because she's been in the bottom consistently over the past three or so weeks. - Ginger Minj. - I would have to agree and say Fame. I don't know how much more she has to offer. - [RuPaul] Trixie Mattel. - Fame. She dropped the ball in her ugly look and her performance. - Violet Chachki. - Trixie got to come back in this competition and she should be looked at with a magnifying lens. So I just feel like it should be Trixie. - All right, Miss Fame. I want to hear from you. - (bleep) all these bitches. (laughing) - Ladies, one last question before you go. At this point, you're all getting to know each other. Who do you think deserves to go home tonight and why? (thunder clapping) Jinkx Monsoon. - Vivienne, only because it seems like she's repeating the same notes that you guys are giving her. - Ivy, what about you? - I would have to say Honey. - Roxxxy. - Vivienne. - Vivienne. - I would say Honey. - Honey. - I would say Vivienne. - Alyssa. - The one that I would want to send home is not in this lineup. (suspenseful music) - Who's not in the lineup that you want to send home? - Charisma, uniqueness, nerve, and talent, I don't see Jade at the same level. He's kind of a little hokey-pokey. This is a drag queen competition. (chuckling) - Ladies, I hate to end on a sour patch, but I have one final question. Which one of you sweethearts does not deserve to be in the top three and why? Starting with Jinkx. - The one who has fallen short most often up here is Detox. - Alaska, same question. - I would say Jinkx Monsoon. Absolutely love her, but I feel like there is maturing that I would like to see. - Roxxxy Andrews. - Jinkx Monsoon. The challenges that she needed to step outside of her box and design and be creative, she didn't do well. I had to be funny where I had to be funny, and when it landed me in the bottom, it landed me in the bottom. - [RuPaul] Detox. - I do agree with the other girls. It's not really a school for girls. It's a competition for the best of the best. - So, who do you think should go home? - I think Yvie should go home just because she's hurt, and we ain't got time for that. (scoffing) - That's a crock of bull (censored). Silky just doesn't want to look shady on TV and tell Ru that she wants me to go home because she doesn't like me, or the fact that I call her out, which is the real reason. - You have your work cut out for you, 'cause this (censored) gotta look like it's on the New York runway. - You'll see it, I promise you. - Okay, you're not-- - Or make me lip sync for my life, that's a guarantee from me. - Okay. (laughing) That's also a possibility. - I ain't afraid. - Okay, all right, Dr. Ganache. - I would love to see Miss Yvie in a lip sync for your life. I'm gonna send that bitch all the way back to Denver. Ready to. - Yvie Oddly. - Howdy-o. - How's your ankle doing? - I haven't had any complaints. - Oh, good, that's good to know. Is it gonna keep you out of the top spot this week? - No, it's not my first time spraining an ankle, and I usually bounce back in a day or two. - Good. - I think if anybody is worried about it, it should be my competitors, 'cause it goes away fast. - Oh, bitch. On that note, who do you think should go home? - Silky Ganache. - Why? - I think Silky has been the most resistant to your critiques and the judges. - Why are you pressed, ho? Bitch, I was in the bottom for being beautiful. A good problem to have when you're me and you can actually do makeup, unlike that bitch who couldn't serve you glam a (censored) day of her life. But I am a threat. America's gonna love me, and I think that bitch knows that. - Who should go home tonight and why? Start with Yvie Oddly. (suspenseful music) - Silky is the one girl who's gotten the same critiques a few times and hasn't ever polished out the things that you want to see from her. - Scarlet Envy. - Well, it came out in the workroom today. So, Silky knows, I guess already. - Nina West. - Based on critique tonight, I'm going to have to say Yvie Oddly. - Shuga. - Unfortunately, Silky, just 'cause the critiques that you've given her, you've given her before, and today was an opportunity for her to really pay attention to those and execute, and it didn't happen. - A'keria. - I'm gonna have to say Yvie, and that's based on overall growth. At this point, it should be only elevation. - Honey Davenport. - Silky's outfit was the least polished on the runway tonight. (suspenseful music) - Silky. - I would choose Yvie. As America's next drag superstar, you have to be kind to people, and she has not been the most kind or the most nice. - Soju. - I would also have to say Yvie because I don't think her drag is on the level of everyone else in the top six. - Vanjie. - Based on tonight, I would say Yvie, just 'cause I feel like she kinda left her sister a little behind. - Ariel. - I would also have to say Silky, just based off the critiques. - Brooke Lynn. - I would have to say Silky. I just didn't think the look was finished, and I just don't think there was a great family resemblance.  Plastique.  I agree. Silky just fell short. - Thank you for your honesty, ladies.
(upbeat music) - Hi, fellas. My name is Ginger Minj and I am an overweight, asthmatic, chain-smoking, cross-dresser from Orlando, Florida. I like to describe myself as a glamor toad. - (kisses loudly) You look gorgeous. - Something subtle to run to the grocery store. - Just a little something to pick up some apples. - I know that I will never be the prettiest one, but I will always be the beautiful one. - [RuPaul] Serving spring glamor, Ginger Minj! - [Minj] I've gotta march the runway in front of Michelle Visage and RuPaul and Carson Kressley. - I think I can here tulle. (judges laughing) - [Minj] But I know that I can excel at anything I put my mind to. - [RuPaul] Let's see what they're serving for fall. Ginger Minj! - Ginger Minj is a plus-sized diva. She always wants to look neat, petite, and ready to eat. - [Kressley] She's like the editor of a magazine. - [RuPaul] Yeah, popular wildlife. - It's so hideous I think I'll put it on the cover. - Ginger Minj! - Good morning, star shine. - Yeah. - Look at her, sweet little lemon drop. Oh. - Oh, we have a crack problem! - [Kressley] See, that's the kind of crack you find on the street. - That's right. - Uh-huh. - [Ginger] My concept is to be naked, but still classy. I'm Southern. I liked to be classy. - [RuPaul] It's quite an impressive pearl necklace. Sometimes they can be so messy. - [Visage] Especially when they're layered. - Hello, hello, hello! (contestants cheering and applauding) Con-drag-ulations, ladies. For today's mini challenge, you need to give face, face, face, while the pit crew blows you (record scratches) with a leaf blower! (contestants sigh) - Damn. - [RuPaul] Oh, pit crew! - Girl! I'm from Florida. I have survived many a hurricane, but never one that's been blowing me right in the mouth. (leaf blower whirring) (dramatic music) (contestant laughing) - The two winners of today's mini challenge are Ginger Minj! (upbeat music) And Trixie Mattel! (contestants applauds) Con-drag-ulations ladies. Music superstar Adele is here. Hey, girl! (audience applauds) - Could I buy a vowel? (audience laughs) - What is that, darling? - No whammies! (audience laughs) - No, no, no. This is the wrong show. - Okay. (audience applauds) All right, are you ready to play the snatch game? - It's time for the snatch game! Woo-hoo, shut up! - All right, first question is for the beautiful Tamar Braxton. Quintin Tarantino is remaking "The Wizard of Oz" as an action movie. In this new version, Dorothy blanks the Tin Man. Alright, Tamar? - Well, she kills the tin man, okay? - All right, let's move on down here to Adele. Where in England are you from, Adele? - My house. (audience laughs) - All right. Dorothy blanks the Tin Man? - Well, if it was me, I would say she rips out his heart and then sings a whole album about it and gets really popular, but- - Yeah? - It's not me. - No, no. - So, I said sheet polishes his chrome. (audience laughs) (RuPaul laughs) - It's a good answer, but not a match, darling. - Well, could I get to match, please? It's a fake cigarette. - All right, next question is for Tamar Braxton. Portia de Rossi says that Ellen DeGeneres is so hilarious even her blank makes her laugh. - RuPaul, I'm gonna have to say coins, honey, makes them laugh. - Coins. - They're so rich they pee pennies, child. - Yes. - Psst, pennies! - Adele, Adele, how much food do you have down there, girl? - Smorgasbord. - I have low sugar. - Oh, you have the low sugar. - I've got to keep it up. - She's using my EBT card. - Oh, Lord! (audience laughs) (contestants sing high notes) - Wrong note, sugar. (audience laughs) - All right, Portia de Rossi says Ellen is so hilarious even her blank makes her laugh. - Sad, sad tears of a clown. (audience laughs) - Yeah, like the Smokey Robinson song. I'm so sorry, Adele. That is not a match. - It's a song. - It is a song, but it's- - Did I sing it? - [RuPaul] No, you did not sing it. It's a Smokey- - So, it's not a good song? (audience laughs) (RuPaul laughs) Probably still won an award for it anyway. - Probably, yes. (audience laughs) ♪ Now, sissy that walk ♪ (upbeat club music) - Ginger Minj. - Yes! - [Woman] It's a nice day for a white wedding. - [Minj] Girl, I'm spinnin'. I'm turnin'. I'm posin'. I am giving them Elvis Prissley down. - Runway Roseanne. - Drag is a religious activity. - Yes, Ginger has a real cross to bear. Kennedy Davenport, great gosh almighty! You rocked the snatch game! Con-drag-ulations, you are the winner of this week's challenge! (contestants applaud) - Thank you. (dramatic music) - Ginger Minj, your Adele had us rolling in the aisles. Con-drag-ulations, you are also the winner of this week's challenge. (contestants applaud) That's right, ladies. First tie in snatch game herstory. - I won! If there was ever a challenge to win, it is this one. - The library is about to be open! Hey! (contestants cheer) (contestants applaud) - Because reading is, what? - Fundamental! - That's right, children. - Mm-hmm. - First up, Ginger Minj! - The library's open, darling. Trixie Mattel making fun of you is like shooting clown fish in a barrel and, fortunately, that's about as fishy as you'll ever be. - Yes, bitch! (crowd gasps) - Miss Fame, I think everything about you is so original, except for those lips, those cheeks and, oh, everything you present to the judges on the runway. (crowd gasps) - Bitch! - Hi, Ginger! Hi, Trixie! - Hi! - Hi, Ru. - [RuPaul] Are you all familiar with Divine's work? - Mm-hmm, when I was younger, I convinced my grandmother that "Pink Flamingos" was a children's movie and I wanted nothing more than to be Divine. That was a changing point in my life. - [RuPaul] Yeah, well she was the first drag superstar. - This week's runway look is the ugliest dress ever. How did you choose your ugliest dress? I mean, did you just go? - I saw it. - And pull it off the rack? Are you feeling good about it? - I'm feeling really good. - You shouldn't trust that feeling. - [RuPaul] Up next, Ginger Minj. Ooh, Michelle's favorite color. - Yay. - It's a Tracy Turnblad look. - [Minj] This is one of the most atrocious frocks I think I have ever placed upon my little body. - [Lovato] It's about as slime green as Katy Perry's hair. - Yes! - Don't do that color, Demi. - [Lovato] Never. - Ginger Minj and Trixie Mattel in "Eggs." Your country breakfast is ready! (country music) - Babs, I'm so hungry! Please come here! - [Minj] I'm comin', mama! ♪ In the morning when the sun comes out ♪ ♪ I get hungry like I've never eaten ♪ ♪ Every day I hear her scream and shout ♪ ♪ Always yelling for her daily feedin' ♪ ♪ All night long I only dream for ♪ ♪ At 10:30, I hear her scream for ♪ ♪ Eggs, eggs, eggs, all I want is eggs ♪ ♪ Eggs, eggs, eggs, all I want is eggs ♪ ♪ Eggs, eggs, eggs, eggs, eggs, eggs ♪ ♪ All she wants is eggs, eggs, eggs, eggs, eggs ♪ ♪ Eggs, another dozen eggs ♪ ♪ Mama, do you want them over easy ♪ ♪ No way, I want them sunny side up ♪ ♪ Since the sun is shinin' ♪ ♪ Has the egg man come to us today ♪ ♪ I'm sure he'd stop by if you stop your whinin' ♪ ♪ Oh, I love him so for bringing what I dream for ♪ ♪ He'll leave another dozen right at the screen door ♪ ♪ Eggs, eggs, eggs, all I want is eggs ♪ ♪ Eggs, eggs, eggs, all I want is eggs ♪ ♪ Eggs, eggs, eggs, eggs, eggs, eggs ♪ ♪ All I want is eggs, eggs, eggs, eggs, eggs, eggs ♪ ♪ All I want eggs, eggs, eggs ♪ - Ginger Minj, this week you gave us green, eggs, and hammed it up. (Minj giggles) Con-drag-ulations, you're the winner of this week's challenge. - Thank you. - The secret to success is being God's favorite. Shh! (judges laugh) - Trixie and Ginger, I'm sorry, my dears, but you are up for elimination. - It is breaking my heart having to go against Trixie. But, as much I love her, I am here to win.

(judges applaud) - Ladies, I've made my decision. (dramatic music) Ginger Minj, Shantay, you stay. - Violet, I think your name, Violet Chachki, is very interesting. Where does that come from? Well, I wanted to figure out what was beautiful and completely worthless: a tchotchke! (contestants laugh) I'm trying to train myself with this corset. I'm really trying to get down to two inches. Why haven't you gotten there yet? 'Case your (beep) wrist is so fat and shoved inside me and I'll never get down to two inches. (contestants laugh) - Hello, Ginger. Holy cow! (judges laugh) - [Minj] Hi, y'all. My nickname is The Country Cow. My utterly charming personality makes people smile and everyone loves my milkshake. Hello Kitty and I love to chew cud together and moo-nopoly. I dream of becoming a designer handbag or maybe even a filet mignon. (judges laugh) - Oh, she was so moo-ving. - Hi. - Ginger Minj. Who's your ally back home, aside from your friends? Do you have any allies in the family? - I know it sounds cliche for every gay boy to say, "My momma's my personal hero," but she's amazing. - Are your parents still together? - No. - Have you maintained a relationship with your father? - When I was 14 going into 15, he left us for his high school girlfriend and I didn't talk to him for years after that. - Wow. (somber music) What do you want your father to know about you that you think he doesn't know? - That's a tricky question because I really don't think my father knows a lot about me. I don't think that my father has said, sorry. (somber music) My entire life, I felt like I didn't even know who my father was. So, how could he know anything about me? Growing up I was so tormented in my life that the only way I could deal was to make jokes and use humor to cover it all up. My relationship with my father has shaped me into the human being that I am today. No matter all the (beep) that's happened in the past, I just hope that he's proud of me. - Listen, I am so proud of you because you are lovely and beautiful and talented. - Thank you. That means the world to me. - All right, darling. Here, well, at least take one of these for the ride home. - Oh, thank you. - I'll see out there. (both smack lips) Ginger Minj. - [Woman] Ginger has fringe on her Minj! - [RuPaul] This reminds me, I've got to take my car to the carwash. - Yes, yes! (dance music) - [Minj] I am making sure these judges see every rhinestone, every piece of fringe, every single inch of this big, bold, and beautiful bitch. - [RuPaul] You know what they say? The bigger the hair, the juicier the ass. - [Man] She is moppin' up the floor with this look. Yes! - Ginger, here's a photo of you when you were five years old. What would Ginger Minj have to say to little Joshua? - When it feels like the entire world is against you, you've always got a friend in yourself and when it gets to that moment in your life where you feel like there's no other alternative and you want to end it, remember that, in your life, there's going to be stupidity coming at you from a never ending parade of bigoted assholes and the only way to survive that parade is to make yourself the grand marshal. - Thank you, Ginger. - Thank you. - Ooh! - Come on, All-stars! Let's get this over with! (contestants laugh) Ribbit ribbit, the glamor toad is in the building. - Where in England are you from Adele? - My house. - I flood my basement, bitch. (Ginger screams) Ginger Minj is back with a vengeance, baby! It's a whole new me! (contestants squeal) - Hi! - Oh my God! It's good to see ya, diarrhea.

You look so much better with half of your face covered. Oh, wait. I'm supposed to be nice this time. I'm wearing a corset though. Apparently, all it takes to win is a corset, so I bought one. - Ooh, ooh, ooh. - We'll edit that out. - Will they though? - No, they will not. - Coco, thank you for proving in season five that orange is the new black.

A stay-at-home mom from Riverside, California, Raven, and a flight attendant who likes long walks on the beach, big (beep), and fried chicken, Jujubee. - Hi. - Ladies, are you ready to meet our stars? - Yass! - Yes! - Praise the Lord! It's Tammy Faye Bakker. - Oy, get he. - Are you wearing makeup? - Just a little chap stick. (audience laughs) - My goodness. You were one of my favorites. - I know. (upbeat music) - This is going to be for Raven. The pit crew has spent way too much time around drag queens. Now, before they slip on their Andrew Christian underwear, they blank. Raven? - They take a very tasteful photo of their nether region so that they can post it online. (audience laughs) They take a selfie. - They take a selfie. Let's see if you've got any matches over here. - Okay. - All right, Tammy Faye Bakker. - As it says in the book, before thou put it oneth, a thongeth. - Yes, uh-huh, yes. - Thou must pray. - Pray! - Pray. - Yeah, I gotta pray before I put on my underwear. - Oh! - Most of the time they don't even fit any more, just so filled with God's love. - Yes, that is not a match. - What? - But, a very, very good answer. It's a very good answer. - I don't- - You tried your best, darling. - I'm trying! - [RuPaul] Ginger Minj, she's gone platinum. - [Man] I like the mermaid cut. Or is it uncut? (woman laughs) - [Minj] I'm just walking so elegantly down the runway. This gown hugs every single curve in my body. I have never felt more beautiful in my entire life. - Yeah, girl! - Yes, you better rub that lamp, honey. - Something's gonna come out. (woman laughs) - Will the bottom two please step forward. (dramatic music) Alyssa Edwards with great power comes great responsibility. Which queen have you chosen to get the chop? - I often tell my students that winning isn't everything. But, wanting to is. I chose the queen to stay based on when I looked into her eyes the conviction that I felt. Sometimes being in the bottom could just be a one night kind of gig. So, the queen that I'm sending home, (suspenseful music) that's Ginger. (dramatic music) - Ginger Minj, you are an all-star. Now, sashay away. - I truly respect to from the bottom of my heart. (contestants applaud) - They got me, girl! (contestants laugh) - Oh, Katya. I love you. You have a lot more to show. - I'm not surprised that Alyssa sent me home. From day one, she's been gunning to get rid of the competition and I feel like I was competition for her. She and I do kind of the same thing. But, I have no hard feelings towards her. (upbeat dance music) Feeling froggy? - No, these women. - It's Ginger Minj, from the top three of "Season Seven" to the bottom four of "All Stars 2." That's right. I'm versatile. Which one of you bitches gave me warts? (contestants laugh) (contestants cheer) I feel like there's unfinished business. The glamor toad is back to claim my crown and I ain't croaking, bitch! - You trying to steal my seat? - Girl, I don't need the seat. I need the crown. Look at this cast, Ru.

I am here to flood your basement and bust your pipe. - [RuPaul] You know, if I were single, I'd Roto-Rooter. (judges laugh) I love Ginger Minj. - [Woman] She is ready for that line dance. - [Minj] Just got a full denim jumpsuit on, some nice thigh-high boots. I mean, I think they're knee-high on most people and there is no rhinestone left unturned or unglued to the back of this jacket. - Looks like a waffle house! - Smells like one, too. - Fergie. - Me! - Ginger, let's go! Let's go! When I think of Fergie, I don't think of one signature move. I think more of an attitude. Really, it's going to be really important to lock into the attitude of it, right? - Let's do it! Jamal Sims is so handsome. - All the step is, is one, two, three. - And his voice is so sweet. - Wop, wop, wop, wop, wop, together. - And he makes me feel like the most delicate, beautiful dancer in the entire world. - [Sims] Take it, de, de, de, de, de. - So, basically he's a magician. - Boom, boom, kaboom, boom, boom, boom, bat. Ah, almost. I can see you thinking about it. The face that I'm looking for is not scared face, right? It should be really smoky and, yes, that's the confidence that I need in the face. Where you start is where everybody else has to either meet or go above, right? So, huge opportunity to set this place on fire from the top. - I'm the first one out of the gate. So, I have to be at this level at all times. But, I feel Fergalicious. I'm a big girl now, London Bridge. I don't, all the references.

We hope you've poured yourself a nice big cup of Bolo. What? Because the tea is full bodied today. - Womp womp. - Yes! - That's right, girls. We are talking about body issues. Now, I know that a lot of people assume that I'm fat because they think I eat too much. What I haven't really shared is that when I was about 14 years old, I was 54 pounds. - Oh my gosh! - Same height I am now. But, I got a bowel obstruction. - Bowel obstruction, it sounds like a punk rock band name. (Minj laughs) - No, but it was screaming from the inside. Actually, how do I put this delicately? I couldn't poop for six months. - And that is the vulnerability the judges are looking for! - So, what they had to do was to go into my intestines, cut them apart, fuse them back together. - Oh, ow. - Oh my gosh. - And then I started gaining eight pounds a week, 10 pounds a week, until I just ballooned up to what I am now and I am five foot, four inches tall, 253 pounds, and, let me tell you, there is not a day that goes by that everybody doesn't slide into my DMs and remind me. (upbeat disco music) - Ginger Minj. - [Woman] Be very quiet, I'm hunting wabbits. (RuPaul laughs) - [Minj] I am serving safari realness. I'm sportin' my hand-painted boots, my fabulous little coiffure pushed over to the side, and I feel like the queen of the jungle. - Ooh, here come Tarzan, baby! The top all star of the week is (upbeat music) Ginger Minj. - Whoa, yes! - Work! - Con-drag-ulations, Ginger. - Oh my God. I just flooded my basement. Thank you. - You've won a cash prize of $5,000. (upbeat electronic music) - Hey, what's up? - Hello. - Hi. - Hello. - Hello! - How are you? - It is time to record our verses with Leland and Freddy. - Hey, everyone. We are here to make "Show Up Queen" a smash. So, let's get started with Ginger Minj. - Girl, Freddy is cute. I would like to invite Freddy to a movie. It's an awful long cord. (upbeat music) (Leland laughs) Makes me feel like a lady. I don't know if he's ever seen "Freddy Got Fingered," but, I (laughs). - Two, three. ♪ I was a short fat kid with a real limp wrist [RuPaul] Ginger Minj, come on Sally Stature. - I'm like J-Lo Devereux on the runway today. I am feeling my finest golden gal fantasy up here. There are 35 yards of fabric in this coat. I know I look good. - [RuPaul] I'm really frond of this print. (judges laugh) It's time to play the snatch game of love. Let's meet our celebrities snatch-lorettes. First up, the legendary comedienne, Phyllis Diller. (audience applauds) - Hi, Phyllis. - Hi. - Phyllis, what's the secret to a happy relationship? - Not knowing each other. (audience laughs) Soon as you learn about the other person, it's time for the old ax. - All right, our first snatch-ler hails from Old Town Idaho. Please welcome Cheyenne Jackson. (audience applauds) (audience cheers) - Hello! - Hello. - Well, you look fantastic. - Thank you. - What's a nice guy like you doing in a place like this? - I guess I'm looking for love in all the wrong places, Ru. - Well, this might be the end of the road for you in many ways, actually. (Jackson) Here's how our game works. You ask our celebrities personal questions and they try to win you over with their answers. When the buzzer goes off, you choose your dream snatch. Simple as that, Cheyenne. (audience applauds) - Snatch-lorette number one, if we get into a committed relationship, my hall pass is Fortune Feimster. Who is your hall pass and why? - Probably the next door neighbor. But, my last boyfriend lived a hundred miles away. Talk about a tremendous sex drive. (audience laughs) It was long. I mean, it wasn't long, but the drive was. (audience laughs) - Got it, yes. - Snatch-lorette number three, if we were going on a two week vacation at a nudist colony what would you pack? - Well, I imagine I would need to bring my waxin' kit. We don't need the whole airport, just the landin' strip. (audience laughs) (RuPaul laughs) I'm that kind of girl. - We can all see what kind of a girl you are. (audience laughs) - Oh. - Well, honey, I don't know when the last time you were able to see what kind of girl you are. (audience laughs) (RuPaul laughs) - They only thing I haven't been able to see in years are my feet. (audience laughs) - Me, too. (RuPaul laughs) - Snatch-lorette number one, same question. - A blind fold probably. (audience laughs) - I will have to agree with her on that one. - I've been trying to close my legs since 1972. I thought I had a lump behind my breast, turned out to be a trick knee. (RuPaul laughs maniacally) - Okay, nothing wrong with that. Snatch-lorette number one, if a genie granted you three wishes, what would you wish for yourself and then what would you wish for Snatch-lorettes number two and three. - Well, I wish that I hadn't gotten that Navy ship tattooed on my chest. I figured it was the only way I'd ever (beep) get across my tits. - Oh my goodness! (audience laughs) You are a dirty girl. - For Snatch-lorettes number two and three, I wish you would shut the (beep) up. (upbeat music) (audience laughs) - You're a very vicious one. (buzzer buzzes) - Oh, that's our buzzer. (audience groans) Cheyenne, who snatched your heart? Is it snatch-lorette number one, number two, or snatch-lorette number three? - I'm going to go with my gut and say snatch-lorette number one. - Oh, you picked the beauty? (audience applauds) I always get my man. Yeah, that's Tiffany's. - All right, Cheyenne, this is it. Only a thin, pink, sugar wall stands between you and the future Ms. Jackson. Move that sugar wall! Say hello to Phyllis Diller. - Oh, hi. (upbeat jazz music) (audience laughs) - Cheyenne, how do you do right now? - I feel- - Like chicken tonight? (audience laughs) - I feel my two favorite emotions, excited and scared. (audience laughs) - Oh. - Another snatch made in heaven. Now don't touch that dial because there's more snatch game of love right after this (upbeat jazz music) (all smack lips) (RuPaul chuckles) ♪ You wear it well ♪ - Category is pop art. First up, Ginger Minj. - She's been framed. - Yes! - [Minj] Every face on this dress with printed out and hand ironed on by me. This is art. Don't censor my art! - There are 15 things I don't like about you, your face! Ginger Minj, con-drag-ulations. You are the the top all star of the week. (upbeat music) (contestants cheer) You've won a cash prize of $5,000. First up, Ginger Minj. - Hi. - Come on, gay pride. - I feel so proud right now. - You should be proud of all of this. Oh, oh, ooh honey. Do you like bears? - Oh, yes. I'd eat one, but that'd be cannibalism. - Yeah! - I don't think she's a real ginger. - Are my roots showing? - Tonight's gonna be a doozy. We are all going to vote on who's going to the finale and the competition is so close. So, all it takes is one little slip up and I could find all of my hard work tossed out the window. So, I'll be damned if any of these other girls are going to out storytell me today. I was born and raised in Orlando, Florida is the lie that I usually tell people because I was actually born and raised in Leesburg, Florida, which is a little Southern Baptist town about 45 minutes north of Orlando and about 45 years behind it culturally. I did my best to make sure I fit in with the locals. But, they took every opportunity they could to remind me I was different. I just didn't know how different I was. I didn't know why I was so obsessed with my mama's makeup and her shoes. I also happened to be really obsessed with "The Wizard of Oz" around this time, particularly the Wicked Witch of the East. You remember her? She had the striped socks, the fabulous footwear. Struck down in her prime by some country bumpkin bitch who stole her shoes and killed her sister? Her. Every time my mama would go to work, I would sneak into her closet, slip on her little bright red pumps, and I would pay tribute to my fallen diva. Well, one day, I guess I got a little caught up in the moment and I lost track of time and while I was playing I turned around and I saw my daddy standing there in the door to the closet, just staring at me. He didn't say anything. He just shook his head and walked away and I was devastated. Later that night, I tried to smile my way through dinner. But, I guess I wasn't a very convincing actor. My mama looked across the table at me and she said, "Now, Joshua, I have had just about enough of that attitude! I'm going to need to see you in the bedroom right now!" (beep)! So I get up. I follow my mama to the bedroom. I close the door and just as I'm turning around to apologize, I see my momma standing there holding a little box wrapped in yellow brick road wrapping paper. She said, "I promise with these, you'll always be able to walk with your head held high." So, I ripped open the box. I threw the paper everywhere and there they were, my ruby slippers. They look nothing like the ones from the movie. There were more of an orangy, hard plastic sling back with little specks of silver glitter and a nice little plastic bow hot glued to the peep toe. Ooh, and a chunky half inch heel! (RuPaul laughs) They were hideous, but I loved 'em! I slipped them on my feet and I could feel their magic running from the tips of my toes to the top of my head and, all of a sudden, it didn't matter when people called me a sissy because I felt powerful. So, I guess you could say my first time in drag was a little out of the box. But, it does prove that one pair of shoes can change your entire life. (upbeat percussion) - Heller. - I just love that there's four country queens doing a nice country song. - Ooh girl! - This is our last maxi challenge and we get to write lyrics, record a song, do some choreography to Ru's brand new song, "This is Our Country." I (beep) love this country ass song, y'all! - How you going, Ginger? - I'm great! I'm just really excited to be here. - You are one of the biggest stars to ever come out of this competition. We're talking talent. We're talking heart. We're talking the total package. You've got it all. You've done so much since the last time you were here. But, you decided to come on back to All Stars? - I'm back, back, back, back, back again! (Ginger and RuPaul laugh) I had a great run on ""Season Seven"" and then I had a really defeating run on "All Stars 2" and I knew that I had unfinished business here. - What do you know about this competition that you didn't know the first two times? - That you got to have fun and you've got to do what makes you feel good and I'm happy. I'm so happy to be here and I have felt unstoppable in this competition. I know I have to get out of here. But, when you and I were on set for "AJ and the Queen," it was my very first day there. One of the actors came up and said, "Oh, do you do drag?" And before I could answer, you stepped in. You said, "Yes, this is my daughter." And the whole point of our relationship came into focus in that moment and I've carried it with me and it's what's helped me to really succeed in this competition, so thank you. Thank you. - Thank you. And thank you for hearing that because it's the truth. You are my daughter. Thank you so much for coming to talk to us and gracing us with your presence and your talent. - We are so proud of you. (car engine stalls) (car engine roars to life) - Hey, Ru? - Yeah? - [Tammy] You mind if I turn on the radio? - [RuPaul] That's the best idea I've heard all day, Tammy. ♪ I can be a queen or I can be a cowboy Up next, Ginger Minj. Ginger has returned to the fold. - She's very layered. - Origami mommy. (judges laugh) - [Minj] This look completely embodies who Ginger Minj was, who ginger mint is, and who Ginger Minj is going to be. It has that classic 1950s housewife silhouette. But, it turns it on its head. So, I feel like a hundred thousand dollars on a crown right now. - [Woman] Honey, your glamor pussy's on fire!- Now, sashay away. (midtempo funk music) - [Queens] Love you, Kandy! (midtempo funk music) - Kandy, Kandy, wait. (shocking cinematic music) Stop. (shocking cinematic music) I'm not ready for you to go. (queens cheering) Not yet. Vivienne Pinay, I'm sorry, my dear, but you are up for elimination. Two queens stand before me. Ladies, this is your last chance to impress me and save yourself from elimination. The time has come for you to lip sync for your life. - The anger that I have is preventing me from being nervous.

Honey Mahogany, (upbeat drum music) Vivienne Pinay, (shocking cinematic music) I'm sending you both home. (shocking cinematic music) I'm sorry my dears, neither one of you showed me the fire it takes to stay. - In the history of "RuPaul's Drag Race", there has never been a double elimination. - Double elimination, of course it is. Why wouldn't it be? - Now ladies, sashay away. (intense hip hop music) Based on the judges' critiques, I've made some decisions. Detox, Katya, con-drag-ulations. You are the two top all-stars of the week. (upbeat pop music) (queens clapping) This week, if you're not in the top, you are up for elimination. (beep) You may leave the stage. (shocking cinematic music) (intense hip hop music) - This feels like the most difficult decision thus far in the competition, because we are determining who gets to go into the final and who has to go home. (solemn keyboard music) Okay, so I'm detecting a very solemn tone. - It is super solemn, everyone did so (beep) great. And then to put us in, like. - I didn't do great this challenge. I got really terrible critiques. And I (beep) up. And I feel terrible about it. And I'm sorry that I won so much, because it (beep) sucks. - [Detox] You're beating yourself up. - Yeah, you need to just stop it. - It's okay. No, I'm uncomfortable, drag (beep) hurts. - [Detox] Let's go, let's do a little one-on-one. Alaska, you're up. - Okay. - I don't want to see anybody go. Everyone did a great job, minus Alaska, but she's been killing the competition, and I've known Roxxxy for 13 years. She's one of my best friends. How am I going to send my best friend home? What am I going to (beep) do? - You can come over here, Roxxxy, come over here. - Come over here. - [Alyssa] We're sisters, all of us. - [Detox] Right. - You know that. I personally feel like it would be you, like, you've been in the bottom five out of seven challenges. Consistency. - Right. - It's Alaska's first time in the bottom, my second time, going into the final four, me and Alaska should be safe, just based off statistics. Do you think that's fair, though? - On the last couple of weeks, I got my critiques to be in the bottom. I don't get today. - But he didn't save nobody. He said, if you're not the top, you're in the bottom. - I guess. - I think Roxxxy is feeling nervous. She's been saved the last three times consecutively, but I think Roxxxy has the upper hand on me because she is her good Judy. (intense orchestral music) - Detox, you're a winner baby. (upbeat pop music) (queens clapping) - Yay! - You've won a cash tip of $10,000. - Thank you very much. - Katya, you're safe. - Thank you. - Will the bottom three please step forward? (intense drum music) Detox, with great power comes great responsibility. Which queen have you chosen to get the chop? - On one hand, you have Alaska who has been slaying this entire competition. And then you have Alyssa who has also been slaying. And then you have my best friend, who, I feel like there have been several times where she didn't necessarily deserve to be in the bottom. And tonight especially was one of them. Unfortunately, I do have to make a decision. (intense cinematic music) I chose Alyssa, I'm sorry, I can't send her home. I'm so sorry. But I just couldn't send Roxxxy home tonight because she's been so amazing, and I just couldn't do it, I'm so sorry. - [Alyssa] Don't be sorry. (Detox sobbing) - [Detox] I feel so bad, I just hate this. (Detox sniffling) - As it is written. So it shall be done. Alyssa Edwards, you are an all-star. (tongue clicking) (Alyssa laughing) Now, sashay away. - Thank you. Thank you guys, good luck, you all. Well now, I was a lovely fourth runner up. (all laughing) I'm not angry, I'm not upset. Today was so magical. I had the opportunity of working with my sister and I did everything that I wanted to do. I can't leave this competition with nothing other than a sense of joy. So I'm pretty proud. Aw. Don't cry. Why are you upset? - Because you're always a winner to me. - That's all that matters. - And they did what anybody else would have done, they eliminated their biggest competition. - Oh, was I the biggest one? (laughs) - [Tabatha] Yes, yes. - Get out! (laughs) That's my sister! (laughs) I'm leaving this a better Alyssa than I came in. That's the win. I am Alyssa Edwards, always and forever. (tongue clicking) - Valentina, my dear. I'm sorry, but you are up for elimination. Two queens stand before me. Ladies, this is your last chance to impress me and save yourself from elimination.

(queens clapping) In a moment, you will lip sync for your legacy. The winner of that lip sync will have the power to bring back one of the eliminated queens. And to give one of your teammates the chop. While you queens deliberate in the workroom, the judges will be giving me a sponge bath. (Adam laughing) Thank you, Adam. I'll be here all week. (Adam laughing) (intense hip hop music) - Oh, my God. I feel for BeBe and DeLa because not only do they have to bring back one of us girls, they have to send somebody home from their group. Tough decision, tough decision. - So I have a question for Trixie, Kennedy, and Shangela. Knowing that you killed the challenge, to be told that, "That was great, but you might "be going home", what does that feel like? - I'm, like, all over the place. Seeing that we have to go by the rules, you know, I understand, that's what it has to be, but it hurts like hell, because I didn't do bad. It just sucks ass. It don't feel good. - Kennedy's upset because she has the worst track record here and had the harshest critiques. So I think she's feeling like it could be her day. - Can we get, like, real? Is this hard for you guys to consider? - It's... I, it's always hard, but I have less of a concept than I ever have of why anyone should go home. I'm trying to pick through what the reasoning would be to send anybody home. I'd love to talk to all three, of the rest of the five. - [BeBe] Same here, come with me. - But it just, it doesn't make sense to me. How do you, how, what do? - What are you gonna pick? Oh, I know. - What do you do? Like, how do you even think about this? I mean, like, how am I supposed to even consider this? I don't have any clue. - I would just not pick me. - That's fair. - No, Shangela has more wins than me. I have a better track record than Kennedy, and I got better critiques today. I know we're at the point where everyone's fierce, but I felt exceptionally fierce in what I did. - Yeah, you, yeah. Got your groove back. Trixie has only had two weeks to start to prove herself. She deserves more time here. I can't send her home. (intense piano music) There's been four other times that I've been standing up here in this position, deciding somebody's fate. And it is always a really difficult decision. It's always really hard to be here. What would you do? - Ladies, I have made my decision. (intense orchestral music) BenDeLaCreme, you're a winner, baby. (upbeat pop music) (queens clapping) Con-drag-ulations, you've won a cash tip of $10,000. - Thank you so much. - BeBe Zahara Benet, you are safe. (intense cinematic music) Now, will the eliminated queens please step forward? (intense cinematic music) DeLa, which queen have you chosen to bring back to the competition? (DeLa sighs) - I think that everyone here is deserving of getting to be a part of this and I'm getting to show their talent to the world. And there's one queen who didn't have as much of an opportunity. (intense cinematic music) So Morgan, get in here and make me proud. - Con-drag-ulations, Morgan, you are back in the game. (Morgan blows air) - [Morgan] Oh, I don't like emotion. (upbeat pop music) - Will the four eliminated queens step to the back of the stage? Will the bottom three all-stars please step forward? DeLa, which of your all-star teammates have you chosen to get the chop? (DeLa sighing) - This is the easiest choice that I have had to make this entire season. (intense cinematic music) I'm going home. (drums thundering) - What? (intense cinematic music) - What did she just say? Did she just say her own name? (intense cinematic music) - I am so, so grateful for my time here, both on the last season and this season. I scribbled out a different one, and I wrote this one in white-out, and let me tell you why. I hope that you don't see this as a sign of disrespect, because I see myself as such a drag race success story. I had such a difficult time on my season, even though I did well. I wanted this opportunity to come back, to fight hard, to show myself what I can do. I have accomplished that, I feel like a winner. I love these girls. I think they all deserve a shot to win. And I am incredibly grateful. I hope that you all can see that. - I'm, actually, I don't know how, how to take this. - I feel so good. I feel like I'm going home winning. - As it is written. So it shall be done. DeLa, you are and will always be an all-star. Now, sashay away. - [DeLa] I love you so much. - What the (beep) is happening? Not BenDeLaChrist, savior of Morgan and the drag queens. But I don't know if that's gonna look good or bad, honestly. - Thanks for letting me be my kind of winner. I had a real good time. (midtempo funk music) I was looking over those lipsticks and none of those answers felt right to me. So I made my own rules and I feel great about it. It's like I proved everything I have to prove. After five out of six wins, what more can I want? This in gold, I have spray paint at home. I know the queens in the top five have had their struggles, and I'm delighted to get to give them the opportunity to live another week. I think the actual title is more important to them than it is to me. (midtempo funk music) - First of all, congratulations on your win. - Thank you. - [Manila] I am really proud of you. - Thank you so much. And thank you so much for this damn mustache. (Manila laughing) How legit, thank you for making it. - I'm so happy that it was able to use it. Well, I wasn't expecting to be here today. So I'm a little gagged, but with so few girls, just any little thing can land you in the bottom. I mean, it was bound to happen after a certain point. - [Naomi] You've been slaying the competition, though. - Thank you. - I grew up watching Manila Luzon, like, I first started watching "RuPaul's Drag Race" when I was in junior high, and that's when Manila was on her first season. So it's (beep) wild to be in this position. What's it feel like being in the bottom with Latrice? - It's painful because I don't want Latrice to go home, obviously, but now it's come to like, okay, well if I'm going to pick between my friend and myself, I have to fight for myself. So I would love to still be here. And this is my first time here in the bottom. I've been slaying the competition. I know I'm big competition. - Right. - Naomi and Monet have a choice right now. They can get rid of their biggest competition, or they can keep me in the game, and fight with the biggest, the baddest, and the best. So it's going to be up to them to decide how they want to play this game. If this is my last day here in Drag Race, ever, I know that I still have my life that goes on, and I have a great life, and I'm blessed. - [Naomi] Right. - You know, and... - Aw, Manila, I seriously love you so much, and I look up to you so much. It's crazy that we're even in this (beep) predicament, your work just speaks for you, and your track record speaks for you, and honestly, you're a legend. - Thank you. (intense drum music) - Naomi Smalls, with great power comes great responsibility. Which queen have you chosen to get the chop? - The queen I've chosen to get the chop tonight in this competition, you taught me to believe in myself when I didn't even actually believe in myself, and I really, really, greatly appreciate you for that. And I'm so sorry that I have to send home Manila. (midtempo funk music) - Oh! (midtempo funk music) - I love you so much. (midtempo funk music) - Manila Luzon, as it is written. So it shall be done. You are and will always be an all-star. Now, sashay away. (soaring synth music) - I love you, I'm sorry. - [Monet] I love you, babe. - Bye guys, kill it. Oh, correction, Ru? That's "Always will be a double all-star". (all laughing) - Okay! (all laughing) - See you guys later! - [Latrice] Love you! (midtempo funk music) - I don't know what I think about me being eliminated tonight. It's a lot to process, especially this late in the game after I've been doing so well, but these queens have to do what's best for their game. Just the same way that I was doing the best for my game. - [RuPaul] Up next, Kandy Muse. - [Michelle] Oopsie daisy! (RuPaul laughing) Show us your tulips. - [Kandy] This look is a recreation of Beyoncé's iconic "Lemonade" look. I have ruffles coming up and down my body, curly blonde hair, and so many flowers, baby, I feel stunning. - She don't just key a car. She beats the (beep) out of it. (judges laughing) Kandy Muse. You're a profess, sis. Keep showing 'em who's boss. - Thank you for changing my life forever. That I can be who I want to be into the world and not giving a (beep) about what anyone else is saying about me. And you've made me feel so, so special. I love you. Thank you so much. - Now, sashay away. - [Queens] Love you, Kandy! (midtempo funk music) - Kandy, Kandy, wait. Stop. I'm not ready for you to go. (queens gasping) Not yet. You are safe to slay another day. (queens cheering) (upbeat pop music) - Bitch, you cannot play with my emotions. (all laughing) Thank you so much. - Thank you so much! - Oh. - Now, con-drag-ulations to all you girls. And remember, if you can't love yourself, how in the hell are you going to love somebody else? Can I get an amen up in here? - [All] Amen. - All right, now let the music play. ♪ I'm a winner ♪ ♪ I'm a winner, baby ♪ ♪ I'm a winner ♪ ♪ I'm a winner, baby ♪ Ladies, queen by queen, one lip sync at a time, you can fight your way back into the competition. - I'm gonna eat tonight.

(upbeat dance music) - Let the final Ru-demption game begin. (upbeat dance music) - Well, that was short-lived. I don't know what's happening, but I just got a message from RuPaul, saying "I need you to get ready "for a lip sync", in which I'm gaggedy-gooped to the goop, we're goop, goop, goopidy goop, goop, goop. Ooh, Miss Thang, I'm about to call Jean Cochran. I got whiplash from this whirlwind. - Welcome back, Eureka. - Hi, Ma. I'm more than determined to get another shot at $100,000.

just picked up two of them i love a good sale i really do i have two moms and they found each other later in life this is my biological mother uh the one i got to know is from i mean we look i didn't know mama she met sherry they're both cherries sherry square they call them they met at the yoga class and it was love at first sight i think honestly they've been together for almost a decade so explain to us how it is to have two mothers raise you basically so i've always been a mama's boy [Laughter] but i have to say how inspired i am by watching their love blossom because they had marriages and kids and careers and that doesn't mean that they were finished becoming who they were supposed to be they are getting married this year and kentucky where it's hard to be queer people right i'm just so happy for them when you speak about your moms i can feel the love that you have for them it's actually something that i envy i've never really opened up about my mother to a lot of people because right now our relationship is a work in progress okay growing up we were actually super close but you know i'm also from a conservative state my mother is a pastor of a church and a lot of times i felt like me just being a family little boy was almost like an embarrassment to her that's that's really hard to hear i remember i would literally wake up to my mother blessing me oh my goodness sometimes i was her baby sometimes i was an absolute stranger so that's the type of relationship that we had it was like very tumultuous very up and down don't get me wrong i absolutely love my mother yeah she raised me the best that she could but i do find myself holding on to a lot of the hurt that i felt as a child i find myself having conversations with her today as that same hurt little boy can i tell you something yeah give me him i had a lot of childhood trauma and stuff like that with my family and someone said to me don't let that hurt child make your grown-up decisions and i will tell you this it changed my whole perception of all this weight that i carried with me for many years it helped me so much girl that spoke something into me girl y'all ain't got no tissue at this uh so i want to talk about the motherhood i experienced now i'm a trans woman i can't give birth but i have taken on the responsibility of having a pet his name is gizmo i love him so much you

from military school she thought i was too feminine she wanted to butch me up i remember that three hour drive i just looked out the window and i was thinking i can't wait to get home to see my best friend donald donald was the gayest guy in town he was there then two guys five guys when i got home there donald was in my front yard he said -i'm gonna take you to the gay club tonight so we jump in the car we get to this club and there's a sign that says queens night life lounge and bar so we walked past the pool tables and there's a room full of drag queens donald said you should do a number tonight i'm like really he's like yeah do it so i get greeted by the most gorgeous glamazon she said miss thing if you're going to be in the show you need to be painted so she sat me down and she started painting my mug and about 45 minutes later i went to open my eyes and this -had glued my eyes together so after pulling my eyeballs apart i hear them saying my name getting ready to go on

gagged i'm like and you're to me everything star should be you shared everything that you've earned and worked for and you're sharing that with the world to have that power means nothing if you're not

thing one time i was at the mall and i bought this cute little bomber jacket okay and i was super thrilled with the jacket and i brought it home and then like a month later i realized what it was reversible and i was thrilled and i feel like that's kind of what happened to you here you thought you were one thing you turned yourself inside out and shocked the hell out of not just us but i feel like maybe you even shocked yourself what a surprise what a surprise and i love that you leaned into your twang in the song when an artist embraces what is naturally there and uses it that's when we have an opportunity to fall in love with you and we absolutely have so proud of you thank you um that twang was something that i used to be ashamed of but i wanted to rewrite that story and i wanted to own that everything i've had in life i've had to work for sometimes extra hard sometimes i work for things and never got it but i kept going and i'm very proud of everything that i've showed you

your boobs coming out of your waist they're just like hey girl but here's the story i'm looking at you and i see round almost it's about definition you want to see the lines in the outfits so it's literally a head and legs and the rest is flowers you guys put so much time and effort into making undergarments that give an illusion and then you're slamming everything on it and covering it up so think about that before you step out onto the runway made my decision calorie chante you stay and they joined the other girls [Music] vanessa vangie mateo you've done your house proud and i have just one thing to say bam sashay away [Applause] miss vanjie miss banji miss [Music] [Applause] to go home first is the worst i wish i could have been here longer i feel like i've let elected down i hope i

embarrassed i thought i was a failure and i wanted to hide it was the worst oh -but then when the whole miss vanji thing went haywire on social media -i made lemonade out of lemon oh let me just go ahead and do it now thank y'all appreciate you cut the check later -i feel very lucky to be back get those cookies get those cookies i want to show america that i'm more than just a meme i'm not a one episode trick pony i'm hiding -i'm about to hide and see what hoes walk in this door cause i don't want them to know i'm here just yet. (midtempo electronic music) (loud, atonal singing) - [Jinkx] Okay, all right. That was just right next to my ear. - Honey, that one's gonna bug me, that little one. She's already starting to bug. Little bitty Serena, she's kinda irritating. And by kinda I mean she's (beep) irritating the (beep) out of me, on a constant. - [Serena] I was born and raised in the Republic of Panama. - Where is Panama? - It's in between Colombia and Costa Rica. It's one of the number one retirement homes for Americans, you should consider going there. - Not if they're all like you. Yeah, 'cause your mouth doesn't shut. - Oh, okay. - It wears thin very quickly. - You know, I have a feeling you just likes to be the only pretty one. - I just think you're annoying. - I can handle annoying. - I can't. Serena tries to read bitches like she can. She is loud, she won't shut her mouth, and I have had it with her. - [Jade] There is funny and then there's just like, blunt rudeness. - Can you not take it, is that why? - Oh, honey, I can take it, you're just like, so immature, it's just really aggravating. - I'm sorry, you're only 21 once and you only audition for this thing once being 21 and get in right away once. - And then do you think because you're younger, you think that's an advantage, but we've all done drag longer, so. - Does it bother you I keep saying I'm 21? - [Jade] Well, no, not at all, I mean, because honestly I look just as young as you, but you just keep- - Are you sure about that? - Oh, girl. - Easy. - Girl, you ain't that pretty. Covergirl don't cover boy, baby. - Go home, Jade. Go home, just go home. Well girls, we will see. - [Drag Queen] We shall see. - Jocelyn Fox, she's so gay even her (beep) has a lisp. Then we have Adore. I know what you got on your SATs, ketchup. - Trinity, I believe your smile belongs on season four, every day is shark week with your grill. Miss Laganja Estranja, next time you death drop reverse that and drop dead. - Adore, you know you're from the west coast because it's a three hour delay before you finally get a joke. Darienne Lake, this is the girl who probably sits reverse cowgirl on the toilet, just so she has a flat surface to eat off of. - Jocelyn, you have some really comforting old fashioned qualities, like how you paint in sepia tones and your voice sounds like a dial-up modem. (modem beeping) Miss Darienne Lake, you have a lot of jokes, but to me they're more like UFO's. I mean, they are way out there and I've never seen one land. - Milk, your beauty and fashion is listed right on the side of your carton, under missing. Ben de la Creme, you remind me of a Russian doll, full of yourself. Adore Delano, I'm going to say this very slowly so you can understand, you're dumb. - So I'm picturing us maybe to be like, drunk lushes. - Oh, okay. - You know, like- - Pinot grigio in the afternoon. I cannot even wrap my brain around it at this moment, that I'm actually doing this thing with Courtney Act herself. She has so much respect for me. And I, of course, have the utmost respect for her. I think like, we should do a makeover. - Does one of us want to be like a before and one of us will be after? - If you were the before- - The problem is, no one would ever believe that you were the after. Right? - What was it like working together? - We've got like a little sister vibe going. - I'm the low rent version of Courtney. So she says. - I may have used that term once, - Joslyn, I mean, you're being very quiet. What's going on? - Tonight in the Silver Lounge, Courtney read my look. - I just think that your drag isn't as polished as the other drag in the competition right now. - You guys really feel like I shouldn't be here? - [Drag Queen] No, not at all. - I do feel that the look tonight wasn't executed as well as the vision in your head. But if you want anything, I've got a whole box full of (beep). - I've got a whole rack of things. - I've been doing drag for 13 years and I'm not being mean, I'm just being factual. But I didn't mean that in any way to hurt her feelings. I didn't want you to think that I was saying that you weren't deserving being in the competition. - I think because I have such a big respect for you, it makes me feel bad about myself. Like, I need you to understand that like, that hurt me really bad. Nothing else has hurt me since I've been in this competition than when you told me that I looked unpolished. - If you need any help by any means, I'm just trying to offer a hand because I would like to see you do even better. - No, and I appreciate you offering me help, but I just, I can't help but take it as patronizing, almost. - Well, I mean, I guess it is a little bit. - At this point I don't know if I look up to Courtney as much. This is not about making friends. Now it's game on. (dramatic music) - All right, Thorgy Thor. Girl, I love you so much. I don't know where they're to give you a hug or put some change in a cup. Bob the Drag Queen, you may be from New York, honey, but those feet are still from Mississippi. - Chi Chi, your drag is just like turkey neck, cheap and no one wants it. - [Drag Queen] Wow. - Naomi Smalls, your wardrobe reminds me of a legendary drag race queen, Nicole Paige Brooks. - The shade! Who knew that was lurking underneath that- - We all knew. - We all knew. - Is a known fact that Derrick Barry is not very smart. When she heard Brittany Spears, she said, does she, I prefer fencing. It is very hard to have an intelligent conversation with Derrick Barry. The only thing harder is Robbie Turner's wig lines. - Robbie Turn-ter, I know you're a huge fan of classic movies and television. May I recommend one of my favorite classic TV shows, "Flipper." - So Valentina, speaking of telenovela drama, Aja had some pretty choice words for you after the princess challenge. - [Drag Queen] What did they say? - Oh my god, some of them- - You're perfect, you're beautiful, You look like Linda Evangelista. You're a model. Did you stone those tights? Oh, you're smiling. They eat her up every single time she's on that damn stage. She doesn't even, she could walk out there in a (beep) diaper. And they're like, Valentina, your smile is beautiful. - I'm not gonna say nothing to that. - Oh my god. - Valentina, what you think of this? - Oh, I loved it. I'm currently working on a number where I just literally come out and just stand there in a diaper and smile. - Aja, what was going on there? - Here's, the thing, if you're in the moment and you have some (beep) to say, say it. So when Valentina was getting so much praise for being this gorgeous, beautiful model, which she is, - She is. - She's kind of a psycho but she's still beautiful. And that day I really had felt like she didn't deserve to be in the top. And I was just over it. I was like, girl. And then I, you know, I don't want to say I read her. I just aggressively complimented her. And I let her know how beautiful she was. - You could see how happy I was. I was like, yes, girl! Get her, get her, J, get her! - I think a lot of us had the feeling that as you were saying it, there was a little bit of a silent amen. Amen, she's saying what we're thinking. - We didn't understand why Valentina was in the top that challenge. A lot of us didn't necessarily appreciate the charm that Valentina was conveying on camera. Because, to be honest, girl, you were not making an attempt to like, really get to know us backstage at that point, it came on a little bit later- - 'Cause I wanted to win. - You wanted to be on the show 'cause you wanted to be a star and you- - I didn't want to be a star, I wanted to show the star that I am. - You are secretly one little bitch and that's why I love you now. But back then, bitch, I hated you so much. And I was just like, I want to send this bitch home so bad. - Now the moment we've all been waiting for. Which one of these bitches have the fans voted Miss Congeniality? Will last year's winner, Cynthia Lee Fontaine, please step forward? (queens cheering) Cynthia, do you have any parting words? - To all the fans of "RuPaul's Drag Race," it was a great and amazing experience. Thank you for your love and support. - Now I have verify these results and I can promise you that this selection was not hacked by the Russians. (dramatic drum roll) The winner of Miss Congeniality, season nine, is... I'm so nervous. - Valentina! (queens cheering mildly) - [Drag Queen] What a surprise. - Condragulations. You've won $5,000, courtesy of Logo. - I dedicate this prize to my mother. She taught me to always be kind and forgiving. So thank you to her. Without her I wouldn't even be congenial. - What? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, I just don't feel like you should be Miss Congeniality. - Do you have anything to say to respond to Aja's claim? - I've been kind to every single one of you and I'll continue to be kind towards success. - Can I say something? - [RuPaul] Sure, go ahead. - [Drag Queen] Everyone else is. - Well, I finally want to say something. Valentina, we literally did everything together this whole show, we were such close friends. And you literally have not spoken to me in almost five months. And I really miss my friend and it really hurts my feelings that you have not spoken to me. - [Valentina] I respect you and love you. - You don't love me. I was a real friend to you. You would not have just dropped me. - Farrah Moan, if you want a friendship, text me, call me, let's talk about it. - I have texted you, you ignore my texts. - I've responded. - You finally responded to me when you got eliminated and I texted you and said, are you okay, and you said, yes. - Okay, let's talk about it. - I would really love to, but it seems like you don't have any time or really any desire. - Like, you are clearly not focused on anybody but yourself. And fan favorite, yeah, great. Like, you have a lot of fans, your fans love you. But is it fan favorite or is it congeniality? - If it's fan favorite than I guess she deserves it. - Then we should call it fan favorite, but congeniality, I just don't see it. - Yeah, fan favorite, congratulations. Everyone, let's make a round of applause for fan favorite. - Work, fan favorite! - Fan favorite! (queens cheering) - Janet Hag-son, oh, I'm sorry, Coco Montrese. How exciting for you that Janet has a new album out. You can both come out of retirement. - Tatiana, thank you, for letting the PAs know who to pack up first. - Coco Montrese, I always wanted to know what the female gremlin would look like in 25 years. - [Alyssa] That was a good one, bitch. - Ginger Minj, In my eyes, the true winner of season seven of TLC's "I Didn't Know I Was Pregnant." Roxxxy Andrews, I think about you all the time, especially in the morning, at the bus stop. Too soon, too soon, sorry. - Alaska, like her outfit, trash. Coco, way too old. and Adore Delano, really? - Y'all bitches are hateful. - Detox. No, really, I mean that. This is actually your intervention. You should really stop this. Adore Delano, these other girls are gonna say you have terrible makeup skills, you have no fashion sense, and you're dumb as a rock, but they're wrong. You don't have terrible makeup skill. Roxxy Andrews, obviously a diet consisting of nothing but hatred for Jinkx Monsoon does a body good. Come on, All Stars, let's get all started, okay? - [Katya] So what happened this week? - I don't know, I guess all I can say is I really wanna stay and I think I deserve to stay. - Alaska doesn't know me very well. And you know, if I win the lip sync, I don't know that she's 100% percent sure I won't send her home, because she's my biggest competition. - I need to go to the end of this competition. I need to. - Party. - Okay. My heart is sinking. I think my spleen is going to explode. Queens in the past have completely disregarded someone's past performance and sent people home because of a terrible critique on the runway. Even I, in the past, so it's terrifying. I (beep) up this week, man, I (beep) up. And it really sucks. It (beep) really (beep) sucks a lot. And I need to be in the finals four. And now I'm potentially looking at, I'm not going to be. And it really (beep) sucks. - I'm shocked with Alaska's behavior. She's really acting like a brat and it's not, that's not attractive. It might throw my thinking process off of the elimination. If you're gonna act like a brat, like, right now, how are you going to act the rest of this time here? - Well, I'll give you $10,000 if you let me stay, before taxes, I'll transfer it to you via PayPal. Because I need to stay in this competition. I need to be in the final four. - I know what it's like to come back to this competition and be sent home again without getting the crown, I know how that feels. The person I've chosen to send home, is Thorgy. - Oh, Jesus, gross. - Thorgy, you are, and will always be, an All Star. Now, sashay away. - Gotcha. I love you guys. - I love you, Thorgy, I really mean that, I really do love you. - Bye, guys. - I am not ready to leave this competition at all. I have so much to give. In comparison to some of the other girls here I think I deserve to stay a lot more. But drag is fun. And then, because I'm gonna hate Shangela for life, how about, "Suck it, Shangella?" And I'm gonna spell it with two L's because she hates that. And then she can (beep) this 'cause it's going that way. Yeah, that's pretty disgusting. Have a good time without me. Bye, it's gonna be boring TV. - It's my first Snatch Game, I have nothing to live up to so feel like I have- - What's this? - The thing of like living up to- - [Trixie] From Thorgy. - Oh, Thorgy wrote this? - Yeah. - It says, "(beep) this shady bitch, Shangela." And it has my name crossed out. - I didn't show it to you 'cause I thought it was not helpful or appropriate. - But you decided to hang it on the wall? - Oh boy, here we go. - [Trixie] My note from Thorgy. I put it by my Milk note. - Yeah, but this one specifically talks about me and then says (beep) this shady bitch and then points out at name. And then you hung it on the wall. - Oh, face crack. I know Trixie's stomach has fallen out of her ass. - Well, I don't care what you think, she gave it to me cause she was sad and I'm honoring her. I like those people - Trixie, you can't tell me that you read Thorgy calling Shangela a bitch and you just saw the goodness in the letter and wanted to put it up. Cut this (beep). - I would not do something- No, girl, leave it now. Now I know you feel that, that's what you really feel about someone like me. I wouldn't put that up against someone 'cause I would not want you to feel bad like that. - I never even showed it to you because I didn't want to- - [Shangela] You hung it on the wall, sis. - Oh my god, get out of my station. - [Shangela] It is what it is. - Ooh, the drama in the pageant. - Bitch, I've got a lot of incense around here, clear the air. - How did Thorgy's feelings about Shangela make Shangela mad at me now? - I think she was just upset because you hung it up and didn't tell her. - Thorgy left a really (beep) message to me on the mirror. I took the high road on that. Then I find out she double dogged me in a written note. Then Trixie hangs the note up on the wall. How much has Shangie got to take? - Trixie is a mess and she shouldn't even have that up there. She put it up there to be a mess. - What do you mean by a mess? - Why would you put it up there? - I wouldn't, but- - My point. So her putting it up there, that's being a mess. - I just think maybe she wasn't thinking about it. - Girl. - Maybe she was just thinking about- - Come on, Ben. Some things you just do not do. If we all supposed to be this sisterhood and stuff, that type of (beep) don't supposed to fly. (dramatic music) - I have the chance to win and take the crown. I am going to lip sync my ass off. - Crouching tiger, hidden drag queen. I'm about to cut this bitch up. - Ma'am, the crown is right there. I am feet away. There's no way I'm going to let this slip through my fingers. Not a second time. - Good luck. And don't (beep) it up! (upbeat music) - I'm bla-ack. I'm Shea Coulee. I know y'all haven't missed me, but it's okay. Wow, Ru. Love what you're done with the place. This was my spot on season nine. It feels kind of lucky. This time I came to win. (upbeat music) - And cracktion! Ooh. (Shea laughing) Guess who's cracking the house, girl? My name is Miz Cracker. I am 35 pounds heavier than I was in season 10. Oh. - Look at this woman! - We've been trying to get together and do a thing. - Yeah, we're doing the biggest of things. - Shea Coulee is talented, beautiful, funny and the worst thing is she is a great person.

Ooh, I did it again. - Woo! - I'm Derrick Barry and I'm from season eight. It's Derrick. bitch. You know me. - Hi! - Hi. - Hi, gorg. - How are you? - What's going on? (dramatic music) - Hi. - Hey, girl. - There's only one queen I don't get along with and it's India Ferrah. - She has got me, girl. - India has these online rants that are negative. She's toxic. Maybe she's all good with giving fake hugs, but I really don't have much to say to her. (dramatic music) - I didn't come to crash the party, I came to end it. (girls cheering) I am Mayhem "The Drama" Miller from RuPaul's Drag Race Season 10. - Season 10's in the house. - This time around, I just can't hold back. I want to make believers out of the non-believers and show exactly why she got the call. (rattling) - I hear something. - Dragging something? - Oh! - Oh! - So y'all thought I'd never get here. Sorry. I was stuck in traffique. My name is Ongina. I'm from the very first season of RuPaul's Drag Race. - She look good. - The one that started this whole shenanigan. Somebody said All Stars 5? - Yeah! - Yeah! - I'm finally on All Stars, bitch. I'm so excited. (laughing) But I'm super nervous because everything literally has changed. But I have been changing as well, and I'm excited to show everyone my 10 year glow-up. So here it is and enjoy! You're welcome! (all clapping) - Now, queens, in the grand tradition of Paris is burning it's time for some serious reading because reading is what? - Fundamental! - That's right.

Bitch, you look hungry, eat a burger. - Girl, whatever weight I lost, you found. - Callate! (upbeat music) - Well look at you, papi. - Hey, mama, here you go. - Oh, my dear friend Derrick Barry. You are a Las Vegas show girl. And you're also a lost Vegas showgirl. 'Cause why the hell are you here? (all laughing) Ongina. I can't wait to put you on top of my Christmas tree. (Ongina laughing) - Mayhem Miller. - Yes? - I think maybe you should switch out the Miller for Coors Light. (all laughing) India Ferrah. This shade is all real. It's no wonder you work at a place called Parana in Las Vegas because with those teeth, you're a walking billboard for them. (all laughing) And also I'm really surprised to see you because I thought you had retired and now I just see that you're tired. (all laughing) - Mariah Paris Balenciaga. Great, you're here so we have to change the name to RuPaul's Drag Race: Some Stars. (all laughing) Mayhem Filler. (all laughing) I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I mean, Meh-hem Miller. (all laughing) Alexis Matteo. I don't want to be shady so I'm not gonna bring up your weight, but when you work, do they pay you in pounds? (all laughing) - Bitch. - Jujubee, the shade. - Mariah Paris Balenciaga. You look like what would happen if Will Smith absorbed Jada Pinkett. (all laughing) Ongina. Thank you so much for taking time out of your busy schedule of auditioning for All Stars to finally join us on All Stars. (all laughing) - [RuPaul] Wow. - India Ferrah. I'm not gonna read you 'cause I'd never kick a man. (all laughing) While he's down. Okay, Blair St. Clair. - You know me. - Mm-hmm. - I don't read somebody unless I have a genuine respect for them. So I think we're done here. (all laughing) - Oh, Miz Cracker, you remind me of my childhood, picking Adam's apples. (all laughing) Shea Coulee. Why so emotional, baby? - Ooh! - Oh! - Mayhem Miller. - Hi. - Every time I look at your face, I'm always reminded it's 5:00 somewhere. (all laughing) - Oh! - Oh! - Derek Barry. You give us Britney like it's always 2008. Now, Ru, can we go ahead and open the door and #FreeBritney? (all laughing) - Shea Coulee, you always say that you've come to slay. How hard are you gonna slay this season? - Is that a question or a read? - No, it's a read. I'm trying my best, you guys. Alexis Mateo. You actually have a really good chance of winning this competition because they've never had a Puerto Rican or a big girl winner. - Right. - Yeah. (crickets chirping) - Okay. The crickets aren't even laughing. - Derrick Barry. You know, the girls in your season said you weren't a real drag queen because you couldn't paint and you could only do Britney, but I completely disagree. I don't really think you can do Britney. (all laughing) Mariah, girl I love you, but your career only has movement because the earth has to spin on its axis. (all laughing) - And India Ferrah. Oh, I'm pausing so we can all Google who you are. (all laughing) - [RuPaul] Put your hands together for India Ferrah. - Ladies and gentlemen, the rules are very simple. No lifting, no touching, no holding, no moving. Do not disturb the queen that you see before your very eyes. So listen up. Drag is not a contact sport.

Forever! - What? - That's right, we're gonna do eliminations a little differently this season. Each week I'll choose one top all star, not two. (dramatic music) In the workroom, the top all star will secretly choose the lipstick of the bottom queen she thinks should go home. And all of the rest of you will cast your vote for the bottom queen you think should get the chop. - Oh my God. - And yes, the top all star of the week will lip sync for her legacy, but she'll be competing against (dramatic music) a secret lip sync assassin. - Oh. - Oh my God. - Oh. - What? - If the top all star wins the lip sync the bottom queen she chose will get the chop. Now, if the lip sync assassin wins, she will reveal the lipstick of the queen that the group has voted to go home. - Miss Thing, if I'd had lenses in these, they would have popped out, bitch.

And I wanted to go outside of the box because I think that I am more than what people see on the outside and I'm giving them exactly what I feel like on the inside.

I would rather compete with you as a friend, honestly. - Like I would rather help each other get to the top and have RuPaul choose. - It's like a Juju sandwich with two pieces of white bread. I'm aroused. - Who knows, you know? In this competition, there's a lot that goes on. We may have other moments where we're frustrated with each other. - Oh, I hope you do because it'sso hot. (all laughing) - All right, all right. - Guys, I want to get to the challenge. - I do too. - We ain't got time for this but I'm very intrigued because I want to see how this goes down. Dun, dun, dun. Excuse me. Excuse me. - Oh! - We just got out of jail. Thank you. (Blair sobbing) Honey, it's all right, it's all right.

We were in there, there was overhead lighting! - Oh! - How dare you! - Jujubee, Jujubee, why did you bribe Miz Cracker to get your daughter into Drag-U? - Because Drag-U was the most prestigious college out there. And I want my daughter to succeed. I think she is the next drag superstar. - Let go of me, Mother! I didn't even want to go to Drag-U. - Blair, can I just say, I follow you on Instagram. - Oh my God, do you really, girl? - I do. - Thank you. - I'd let that Blair St. Clair influence me any day. #Fiiine! (all yelling) You know what I mean. - Oh, I think I just said I was in a gang. - If I'm going down, you're going down. - I have gone down. I know you're going down too if we play our cards right. - What? - I'm wearing the butterfly ring you gave me. - Oh please, let your butterfly flap a little more for me, love. All you have to do is tell these reporters there is absolutely nothing going on with us. - Wait, what, Mom? - I love you, but I can't. - Ooh! - Ooh! - Juicy! - She's hot too. - I know our friendship has been over more bumps than your foundation stick, but it's time for us to stick to together. Tell SheMZ that I am innocent. - No, I have proof. It's in my pocket book! - I want to see it, I want to see it. - Do you wanna see? (laughing) - Wait, is that Blair's face on Laganja Estranja's body? Perhaps, possibly, maybe. - All this proves is that I taught her the key elements of drag: charisma, uniqueness, nerve, and also Photoshop. There is nothing wrong with that in this era. - Here's a clap for your performance. - Miz Cracker. (dramatic music) Con-drag-ulations. You are the top all star of the week.

That is so gorgeous. - Thank you. - Tommy, are you feeling the love? - Primarily from my gut down. - Oh, from your gut down. That's a good sign. - But it might be because the belt is cutting off my circulation. (RuPaul laughing) Contestant number two. - Mm-hmm. - Women are jealous of my blank. - Women are always jealous about my sixth sense, because I can predict the future, and I can see the present. I bet you you have a belt right now.

No complaints and not many symptoms these days. - Alright, contestant number two, same question. - The first thing somebody notices about me is my big, wet smile. (Ru laughing) - Ooh. (Eartha purrs) - Contestant number three. - What they normally notice is my big, fat, 14-inch clock. You know what time it is? No, really, I'm asking. My clock's been stuck on 4:20 since 1985. (all laughing) Woo! (Eartha purring) - Contestant number two, I'm originally from Canada, so if we went up there for a winter visit, how would you keep me warm at night? - I would sensually walk to the thermostat (all laughing) and turn up the thermostat to a sensible 74. (Ru laughing) (Eartha purring) - I need a woman like you in my life. If this (beep) don't work out, we should bang in the parking lot. (all laughing) - Juju and Shea are doing so great, I should feel terrible. But I'm laughing too hard to worry about that. This is a masterpiece. - Contestant number three, same question. - The best way to keep warm is to pile in a bed with six other bitches. And by bitches, I mean teacup Pomeranians.

I am so confident in this challenge. I'm, ooh, I'm gonna take this. Bitch, I am lying 'cause I'm scared. I am going to poop myself, because this is terrifying. That's the honest truth. This is hard. This is hard. I hate this challenge. - This other side is the right side of it. And then you have all these- - Well, how do you know that it's the right side and the wrong side? - See how you can see those, like, lines running through it from where it's been woven? You're kind of seeing all that and how it's smooth on this side? - Yes. - And can you tell this is the right side. When you look over at cute little Jujubee, and, like, "Help me, "I am just not the kind of person that can be like, "No, bitch, this is a competition." Like, of course I'm gonna help her. I know that you're not necessarily trained in sewing and building costumes. But the same type of, like, energy and creativity that you apply to your performances, apply to this. - Thank you. - You got it. (upbeat music) - Don't do this to me! Girl, that moment when the material you chose is not going through the machine. - What's T? - It's just I'm having to figure out how this material is gonna go through the machine, because she's giving me a little trouble right now. - Tension is tight, so you might wanna loosen this up. - Okay. - And then your length is super short. So that's also making it- - Right. - So maybe like two and a half, three. - Yeah, okay. - Will probably help that. - Shea. - Yes? - You never told a lie. - Never told a lie. - It's working perfectly. - Bam. (upbeat music) (RuPaul laughing) - Get it, girl. Well, hey sis. - Hi. - Hey. Y'all remember back in the day when I performed in drag at the Charles family reunion? - Absolutely. (both laughing) - Well, this is the remix. Y'all know who this is. (woman laughing) Category is Country Cousin Realness. (laughing) (horse neighing) (all laughing) Up first, Miz Cracker. - [Miz Cracker] Hello! I'm RuPaul's second cousin twice removed by court order. I'm joking, mostly. My name is Jocelyn Opal Rose, but the family just calls me "She's got a lotta nerve showing her face around here after all these years." (RuPaul laughing) Ooh, for the backyard fish fry, I brought my world-famous "things I could find at the gas station." Today I'm planning to spill a little secret. My doctor told me that Ru isn't just my second cousin, she's my perfect match, and I could really use a kidney right now. (coughing) (laughing) - [Michelle] Stevie Hick. - [RuPaul] Jujubee. - [Jujubee] Sorry I'm late. I didn't wanna come. (laughing) (all laughing) I'm RuPaul's Asian bestie, 'cause once you go Asian, that's all you be cravin'. My name is Ping, but everybody in my family calls me Amber. (all laughing) I hope you like my outfit. For the backyard fish fry, I brought my famous potato salad with raisins, which I made with potatoes and raisins and my secret ingredient: MSG. Mm. Today I'm planning on spilling a family secret. RuPaul isn't just my bestie, she's my psychological mommy dearest. (laughing) Bye. - [Carson] She has hat it. (all laughing) - [RuPaul] Shea Coulee. - [Shea] Okay, y'all! It's me, Ru Paul's baby niece, Sheaquita, but everybody calls me Lil Ki-Ki. I'm wearing a one-of-a-kind airbrushed T-shirt by my cousin Pookie in loving memory of my Big Mama. Today I was running a little bit late. so all I was able to bring was the bag of "She already done had her chips." That was in my glove compartment. But my family secret is that not only is RuPaul my great auntie, but she also my best friend. For real, though, Auntie Ru. Now, make sure y'all save me some potato salad, 'cause I'm gonna be right back. - [Carson] Well, she left the tags on this. - [Michelle] She did. - [RuPaul] First, Miz Cracker. Good girl gone badminton. (all laughing) - [Carson] Hey, what's all the racquet? - Ladies, I am ready to serve. I'm bringing Fifth Avenue to the backyard, and I'm bringing it to you with a fascinator made out of a racquet and a wiffleball. I have wiffleball earrings, I have a shuttlecock on my throat, I have a shuttlecock on my shoes, and I have a shuttlecock under my skirt. - [RuPaul] You know, it's strange to see her alone. She's usually with a net. - [Michelle] Oh, my God. (all laughing) - [RuPaul] Jujubee. - [Carson] Look at the melons on her! - [Michelle] Now, do you spit or swallow? Oh, the seeds, the seeds, guys! - [RuPaul] The seeds, the seeds. - [Jujubee] Ooh, girl, I am giving you the only Laffy Taffy Miss Taffy USA mama. Mm. (clicks tongue) I'm wearing watermelons, my favorite fruit. My hair is just absolutely perfect and coiffed. Nobody's touching this. I'm the watermelon lady. - [Michelle] She's got a peel. (all laughing) - [RuPaul] Shea Coulee. - [Bebe] Oh, marry. - [RuPaul] Who invited Grace Jones to the picnic? - [Michelle] Here comes the bride all dressed in assless chaps. - [Shea] I am serving you backyard bridal realness. I've got my jumpsuit with my chaps, I have my beautiful mosquito net veil, and all my family and friends are here to see me tie the knot. - [Carson] She's putting the "ass" back in "Kansas." (all laughing) (dramatic music) - Miz Cracker. Con-drag-ulations. You're the top all star of the week. (upbeat music) (all clapping) - Oh my goodness! Hello! My name is Miz Cracker and I am so happy to see people. I don't know if you know this but if you are a drag race contestant they do not let you socialize, like at all. They say, this is like the Olympics of drag. No, this is like Gay-tanamo Bay. Whoops. (audience laughing) Please help me. I am a new Yorker, but like not in a mean way. I am a Jew. So I get to say it that way. You do not. (audience laughing) But most importantly, I am a drag queen. I've been telling these girls from the beginning, like let's just be nice to each other tonight. But I guess I'm like Shea Coulee's music because nobody listens to me. You know what I'm saying? (audience laughing) There's this stereotype that drag queens have to be like beautiful in their makeup and glamorous and everything, but that is not necessarily true. Look at Juju. Okay. Look at her. What was I saying? Oh right. Humility and love. That's where it was. (audience laughing) Also I'm against body shaming completely because I was a chubby kid and I know what body shaming can do to a person. You know? It works! Yeah! (audience laughing) Ow, ow, opulence! Everything you see is on sale! Yeah! Oh! Thank you everybody so much. (audience applauding) I appreciate you so much. - Hi, everybody. How are you doing tonight? (audience cheering) Oh, come on. You guys can do better than that. You had Miz Crackers entire set to take a nap. (audience laughing) Come on, so how are you doing tonight? (audience cheering and clapping) Oh, that's so much better. Ladies and gentlemen, we've got the lovely Ms. Blair St. Clair here. And you guys, I don't want to ruin too much but she had a bit of a rough week last week. She failed her driver's test. (audience laughing) Miz Cracker, make some noise for her. (audience applauding) I love her. She's just, she's just so animated, larger than life. It's like she's a living, breathing puppet. You know, she's got this big head and he's tiny little feet and only becomes animated when you put your fist in her. (audience laughing) Yeah. Yeah. Has anyone in here ever been robbed before? Well, I have and no, I'm not talking about the finale of season nine, but for real, you know, it's been quite an interesting journey for me. I've been going to therapy and for the longest time I thought that therapy was just for white people with money, and I was wrong. It is also for black people with money. (audience laughing) But it's kind of embarrassing to tell your therapist that rose petals are one of your triggers, you know? For real, like rose pedals have been following me around for the past three years like I'm James Earl Jones in "Coming to America." (audience laughing) The only difference, he had a crown. (audience laughing) Thank you so much. That's all the time I have for today. (audience applauding) - Category is Freak Out. Let your freak flag fly. First up, Jujubee. - [Michelle] Oh my God, you guys, we found the missing link. (all laughing) - She's definitely got a point. - [RuPaul] Yes, she does. - [Jujubee] This look has a broken heart, but it's healing. And when I take the mask off, you see there's still emotion behind this monster. And these shoes are 10 inches and I can only take seven on a good day. - She has such a checkered past and present. (all laughing) - Jester? I barely know her. (all laughing) I do declare, Blair St. Clair. - [Michelle] Somebody's getting some tail tonight. (all laughing) - [Ross] You guys, she's spotting. (all laughing) - [Blair] I'm giving you feline cat fantasy meets the Blair St. Clair experience. I have a Velcro harness on, and who does not want a tail? This is my Alice in Wonderland Cheshire Cat on acid. Purr-fect for a party rave. - This is what my cat thinks it looks like. (all laughing) - No Dalmatians or Muppets were harmed in the making of this costume. - [RuPaul] Miz Cracker. - [Michelle] What is she crowing about? (all laughing) - [Ross] Edgar Allen Ho. (all laughing) - [Miz Cracker] My look today is a post-apocalyptic steampunk death mask, and underneath is this very sexy woman who's here to seduce anyone that sees her. - [Ross] I've heard of a scarecrow. This is a Cher-crow. (all laughing) - [RuPaul] Schnap out of it! - [Michelle] Do you believe in the apocalypse? (all laughing) - [RuPaul] Shea Coulee. - [Michelle] Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, the Gay Years. (all laughing) - [RuPaul] Scam money don't make money, but freak money do. - I'm serving you some 90s raver realness. Hand-dyed Mongolian lamb coat, my beautiful bondage Cookie Monster platform shoes, my pupils are real huge, and I'm just dancing to the music, having a good-ass time. - [Ross] She is schooling the kids with those pupils.

But since I've been on the show, I became the meme queen. And I'm always in somebody's video or clip. You know, I don't understand why people's breath be motherfucker's stink and they don't taste it.

(Alexis laughs) - (beep) When we did All Stars 1 in teams, it was the gagger because we weren't expecting to have to work with someone the entire season. - [RuPaul] Latrila! - This has been like the best pairing in the world because like you always know how to take it that extra step beyond, and I love that. - Manila and Latrice, sashay away. - This time is gonna be different. - Now, ladies. Latrice and Manila competed as a team in the first All Stars. But I invited them back to compete as individuals. - Yeah! (queens cheer) Woo, girl. I am very relieved that there's not a team situation. But at the same time, having Latrice and Manila here, things literally just got three times harder. They're two of the most fierce competitors in Drag Race history. Game on. - The library is about to be open. - Yeah. - Yeah! - Because reading is what? - [Queens] Fundamental! - That's right.

(all laughing) That's how it's done, ladies. That's how you read. - Monét X Change, I'm sure you get compared to Bob the Drag Queen all the time. And in this competition, that's a good thing. Because at least you know you'll beat Naomi Smalls. - Oh! (laughs) - A two-for-one read. - Yes, honey. Monique Heart, do you remove your makeup with flushable toilet wipes? Because you're an ass and your makeup is (beep). - Ah! (all laughing) - All right, now. The library is closed officially. And, ooh child, I'm gonna need some aloe for all them burns.

Back then, I never thought love, monogamy, family would be a possibility for me. I was unpacking once we got here and I found a note from Christopher in the bottom of my tote. - Shut up. - Yeah. He just wanted to let me know that at all costs that I had somebody that was at home waiting for me. You know what I mean? And it's just like... It's the best feeling in the world to have someone that's in your corner now matter what, win, lose, draw. Unconditional love. I did fight the fight to help get marriage equality passed in all 50 states. And knowing that I could actually legally love the person that I love and feel traditional was the biggest triumph that I've ever felt. - Category is Boots the House Down. Trinity the Tuck. - [Michelle] Uh-oh, guys. Is it me, or are her legs buckling? - [Trinity] My look, bitch, is sickening. I am channeling 1990s Versace, Chanel. Sorry, Valentina.

I don't know. - Is that the cake right there? - This is the cake right here. - I'm watching Latrice keeping quiet and just kind of letting Monique steal the focus. This was her chance to have her redemption from her Snatch Game. Latrice has to bring it times two, times 10. - So first of all, your honor, she puts white people on the cake. (audience laughing) Where's the tanner? Oh, my gosh. It says "Lisa". My name's Anastasia. - Oh, boy. Okay. - So it says, "Lisa is a total skank and everyone knows it." They call her a door knob. A door knob? - Everybody gets a turn? - Ah. So, your honor, I'm suing for $500, the price of the cake. But then also, I want an additional 5,000. - For? - Pain and suffering. - Okay. - Emotional distress. I was called a whore, a doorknob. She's over there looking like a big butter turkey ball.

(all laughing) Many know her as Lady Bunny but I like to go by her original drag name, Methuselah. (all laughing) Or as they know her down at the clinic, Patient Zero. (all laughing) She was often called the Beyoncé of drag, not because she was rich and beautiful and famous, but because she looked like she was carrying twins. (all laughing) Look at that big bloated bitch in that box. (all laughing) Have you ever seen her out of drag? Anybody? Category is Ben Franklin (beep) the Michelin Man. Amen. - Ooh! (all laughing) - You know, this reminds me of a story when we all went on tour. Bunny expressed that she wanted to eat a little Mexican. (sniffles) Poor little Valentina didn't stand a chance. (all laughing) - Oh! (all laughing) Dearly beloved, and Michelle Visage. (all laughing) At least our poor Lady Bunny met her fateful demise doing something she loved, when she choked to death at a hotdog-eating contest. (all laughing) When the doctors performed the autopsy, they found that she was full of seamen and the aircraft carrier that they served on. (all laughing) Here, I have Lady Bunny's last will and testicle. (all laughing) To Trinity the Tuck, the Lady Bunny has left her biggest synthetic wig to you that she melted down so you can inject it directly into your ass. (all laughing) Monique Heart, the Lady Bunny leaves you her crusty, dusty old lashes, because she thought you needed a newer pair. (all laughing) And last but not least, to Lady Bunny's oldest friend, RuPaul, Lady Bunny wants you to know that finally, you're the pretty one.

What if the theme is being a model? - Club Diva where you can be queen for the night. - Divas, divas... - 'Cause you too should feel like a queen. - There are so many aspects of this challenge. Is this a design challenge? Is it a comedy challenge? Is it a promoter challenge, or is it a host challenge? It's all of it. The way my mind is going and the way that I'm feeling is too many things at once. - Our decor... Let's keep it really fresh and modern. - Fresh, modern, clean. - Interior illusions lounge meets- - Modern day disco. - Ooh, I like that. - Let's have like a nod to Studio 54. - So 54, we can use a number. What's the best number to use? - Uh, 69? - 69. Cue the rolling eyes. - Yeah, it could be a little too expected. (Valentina gasps) (Naomi laughs) - Oh, my God. Let me take a sip of my French vanilla fantasy. Okay, bitch, I just felt the fantasy. Hold up. Hold up, hold up. (Valentina slurps) - Valentina lives in a whole another world where it's run by French vanilla fantasy, champagne and red M&Ms. I'm entertained by all the weirdness. But the fact that we've never worked together is kinda scary. And I'm not sure how this is gonna turn out. - [RuPaul] First, let's get lost in The Black Hole with Monét X Change and Monique Heart.

Well, I wasn't expecting to be here today, so I'm a little gagged. But with so few girls, just any little thing can land you in the bottom. I mean, it was bound to happen after a certain point. - You've been slaying the competition though. - With the- thank you. - I grew up watching Manila Luzon. Like, I first started watching "RuPaul's Drag Race" when I was in junior high and that's when Manila was on her first season. So it's (beep) wild to be in this position. What's it feel like being in the bottom with Latrice? - It's painful because I don't want Latrice to go home, obviously. But now it's come to like, okay, well, if I'm going to pick between my friend and myself, I have to fight for myself. So I would love to still be here. This is my first time here in the bottom. I've been slaying the competition. I know I'm big competition. - Right. - Naomi and Monét have a choice right now. They can get rid of their biggest competition or they can keep me in the game and fight with the biggest, the baddest, and the best. So it's going to be up to them to decide how they wanna play this game. If this is my last day here in Drag Race ever, I know that I still have my life that goes on, you know? And I have a great life and I'm blessed, you know? And... - Manila, I seriously love you so much, and I look up to you so much. It's crazy that we're even in this (beep) predicament.

Just get it out, bitch. - Get it out, bitch. First of all, I'm like, I'm gagged- - [Monique] The goopery. - That Manila is gone. Like, I was like this bitch was her first time in the bottom and she'd won the most challenges. - The goop. No, bitch, we were... (Monét laughs) - Manila deserves to be in the competition to the... Like, so far to the end. - According to her track record. - Her track record. - Girl, I'm just gagged. I definitely think that up until now, the eliminations have been pretty fair. But now it's all out the window. I mean, girl, Manila just got ran over. Bitch. I just gotta get comfortable. (all laughing) - [Naomi] Let's get serious. - Okay, shady princess. Like, what was your reasoning? - I think a lot of different reasons. Yes, Manila has been doing so well in the competition, but I don't know if she necessarily has my back. I sent Manila home because I wanted to. Manila was crazy competition and that's dope but I decided to save Latrice 'cause I owe it to her, she saved my ass last week. If it looks shady, so be it. I have a close relationship with you so I chose you. - Thank you so much. - I love you. - Thank you so much. I love you too. - How do you feel about Manila going home when she was a wreck because she couldn't save you? - And bitch, we mean a wreck. She was sobbing. - Sashay away. - Thank you all.

But I really, really saw her here with me through to the end. You know what I mean? It comes down to someone has to go, and if it's me or her, like, you know, of course, I want to stay. My love has never wavered for her. I just, we can't have it both ways. - I want to know who Monét picked. - Yes, bitch. It's tax season. Show the receipts. - I chose Manila's ass too. (all screaming) - Wow! - Manila shaded me. - [Manila] I'm sorry, girl. - And even though we have resolved our issues and we spoke, bitch, I'm a petty bitch from Brooklyn. I hold on to grudges. - #TeamPettyBitch! - I'm petty, girl. Manila played a shady game and it got her out, girl. Like, she was willing to send me home to save her friend. So I am not hesitant to show these girls this lipstick. I wish I would have done it onstage. I would not have given a backstory. No explanation. This my lipstick. - Look, hold up, okay. I'm just... I'm just like all kinds of everywhere. - I think that you are living for this. - She's living! She's living for it. - No! - She loves the drama. - No. Listen. This is shady. This is some shade- - No, it's not shady. - No, listen. Let me finish what I'm saying. You are a (beep) shady bitch for doing that. - Why? - And you're a (beep) shady bitch for doing that. But thank you so much. (all laughing) - I think we're realizing that this competition now we're not gonna be judging it fairly. Because what's fair? - Right. - Life's not fair. - Life's not fair. - Get used to it. - So bitch, good luck. And you cross me, you going home next. Just to be clear. - I'm nervous. I'm nervous. Manila went home 'cause she was competition. And at this point, I am tied with Monét for the most wins in the competition. So girl, I might be next on the chopping block. - Hey-ya! - Do you like my look? It's Dolce and Gabbozo. - Listen, if it's gonna help me snag the all important clown vote, why not? - Can I smoke in here? - Well, if it isn't the insane clown posse. Get a load of my insane clown pussy. - Cut. You? What are you doing here? - I couldn't resist a clown theme. I mean, who doesn't love a big top? - Ugh. - Oops. I did it again.

And with this beautiful dreadlock updo, I feel really strong, really powerful. And I feel like a (beep) winner, girl. - [Carson] I'm quite frond of this. (all laughing) - [RuPaul] Wakanda forever. Black, black, black again. - [Ross] Aw, she's in glove. - My look is very very couture. I feel gorgeous, I feel expensive, I feel regal. I feel like this is a good wig to have that crown put on. So (tongue pops), she's ready. - [Michelle] I think the crop is ready. - [Todrick] She's walking in a crop circle. (Michelle laughs) - Aw, shucks. (all laughing) - [Ross] What to wear when your elbows are fat. (all laughing) - [Michelle] Guys, this could get meshy. (all laughing) - [RuPaul] Ooh. - She skirted the issue. - She did. (RuPaul laughs) - This is Naomi Smalls at her highest form. I am shining from head to toe. I am looking rich, bitch. I am looking opulent. I own everything. - [RuPaul] Oh, she's gonna take the train home. (all laughing) - [Ross] Better hurry, that's a midnight train to Georgia. (RuPaul laughs) - [RuPaul] Dress by Vivian Wedgwood. - [Michelle] Wedgwood you if you could? (all laughing) - Ooh. - Oh. - [Carson] Well, I thought she was an A cup but she's obviously a tea cup. - Walking down the runway for the final time, I feel stunning. My gown is absolutely incredible, and I don't think I've ever felt better in my life. You wanted some tea? Well, you're in luck. 'Cause tonight is piping hot. - [Michelle] And there's her saucer. - [Carson] Tea? Party of two. - Oh, she's using the good china. Welcome back, ladies. Based on your performances tonight, and throughout this competition, I've made some decisions. (suspenseful music) Monét X Change. Trinity the Tuck.

Would you please step to the back of the stage? (all applauding) - I'm leaving here with my head held high. I feel like I really proved to myself that I can compete against the best of the best. Naomi Smalls is going to continue to grow and continue to surprise you and take over the motherfuckin world, bitch. (chuckles) - I'm extremely proud of myself. I said I was here to reclaim my time and I did. I didn't snatch the crown but I was close to it. But it is not the end of my story and I know it. - Monét. Trinity. There's only one thing standing between you and the Drag Race Hall of Fame. Two top All Stars stand before me. Ladies, this is your last chance to impress me and to prove to the world you belong in the Drag Race Hall of Fame. The time has come for you to lip sync for your legacy. - I am super close to winning this whole competition, girl. It's just a lip sync stands between me and a crown, a scepter, and $100,000. I can taste the crown and I want it. - Everything in my life has led me up to this moment. I'm so close to my dream.

You each win $100,000. - Oh, my God. Yes. (all applauding) - The world is watching, Monét. What do you have to say? - This is further proof that long live the sponge, Michelle! (all laughing) - Congratulations. - Thank you. Yes! - Trinity, is there anything you'd like to say? - Girl, money can't buy everything. But is sure can pay for a lot of plastic surgery, bitch. (all laughing) Botox, here I come. - All right. Now, prance queen. Prance, I said. (RuPaul laughs) ♪ You're a champion ♪ ♪ Never gonna fall ♪ ♪ You're champions ♪ - To everyone who has underestimated the power of Monét X Change, this is the boo-yah moment, girl. This is when you are eating your words, and you are realizing that Monét X Change is a fierce queen. This feels so good. It feels right. And bitch, I got $100,000. My exchange rate is about to skyrocket, girl. ♪ And you'll always be a hero ♪ ♪ You're a champion ♪ - This competition has pushed me more than I have ever been pushed before. I came here to finish what I started. And bitch, I won. It just feels great to hear those words. Trinity the Tuck, All Stars 4 winner. Where's my picture? Hang her up. $100,000 and a crown, bitch. (RuPaul laughs) - [Monét] Yes! - Now, remember, if you can't love yourself, how in the hell are you gonna love somebody else. Can I get an amen up in here? - [All] Amen. - All right. Now, let the music play. (upbeat pop music) - Did somebody order a hooker? (Pandora laughing) Ugh. My biggest weakness last time was that I truly didn't believe in myself. This time around it's gonna be different because I'm fabulous. - Pow! Like that. - Latrice (beep) Royale. You look gorgeous. - You look gorgeous. Pandora Boxx looks stunning in her black and white. She stepped it up. Girl, I wanna know who they gon' bring up in here. (Pandora chuckling) There's a lot of attitudes and a lot divas. Pandora and I, we are Miss Congeniality, so I'm waitin' to see what bitches lurk behind the door. (Yara cackling) - Yeeeeeees, mami! - [Latrice] Yara Sofia. - La perra's in the house! - Zanier than ever. - Miss Congeniality. - Hi enchilada. (Pandora giggling) - I don't think you have on enough jewelry, bitch. - I look like Puerto Rico's very own jail Barbie. (queens laughing) Yes. - Hello, hello. - Oh. - Heeeey! - What's up? Do you like it? - [Latrice] It's a little somethin' somethin', girl. That bitch has on everything. - Something subtle for the daytime. - You know, you know. - Let's do this, bitches. (queens cheering) All-Stars! - Yes, baby! - I know the four queens sitting there as I walk in are thinking, "this bitch looks good." - [Shannel] Love your dress. - Raven walked in from a cocktail party, it looks like. Thanks for trying, girl. - The jig is up, bitches. - [Queens] Ohhhhh! - Look at you all cross-dressers looking cute. (Latrice cackling) - Happy Hunger Games, bitches. - [Queens] Ohhhhh! - Alright, competition's on. - Hold on, I'm getting a call on my Bluetooth. It's Sharon. You what? You wanna give you my $100,000 back? (queens laughing) - Watching Chad play with his little earring, I'm thinking, "this bitch is kinda bitter." - [Queens] Ohhhh. - See, this is how you do drag, girls. - As soon as Manila was in the room, I still know that Manila is annoying. - Oh, I'm so glad you covered up your face. (Alexis chuckling) - Ahhh! Life is like a paycheck, a generous figure is always nice. - [Latrice] Liza Minnelli! Are you kidding me? - Get the (beep) outta here. - Mimi (beep) Imfurst walks up in this bitch. Why? - Someone's gotta go home first. (queens laughing) - I think people are surprised to see me, but I look good. - Loca! Loca! Loca! (queens cheering) I love it! - Nina Flowers is a legend. I just love to look at Nina, she's like eye candy. - Bitches, we're making history. Okay? (Nina laughing) - Ahhh! (queens cheering) - Jujubee's here! And she's lookin' hot in some red hair. - I (beep) miss you, bitch. I feel a little underdressed. I look like I work at the mall compared to you guys. (queens laughing) - You do, girl. (Manila chuckling) - Oh, bitch. - Tootsie loo! - [Jujubee] Hey, look who's here! (queens clapping) - I am huge Tammie Brown fan and I love that little ... Girl, makes me queef. - Now, my dears, on your own none of you were able to reach the top. So, this time around you'll need to add an S to your charisma, uniqueness, nerve, and talent. And the S stands for synergy. That's right. Starting today, you'll be competing as teams of two. - [Latrice] O.M.G. (beep) (Alexis laughing) - What? - You'll be judged together from challenge to lip-sync, and if one of you fails, you both go home. - Oh God! - [Latrice] What? - The ultimate shaaaaaade of it all. - I really came back to All-Stars to prove something, and now it all depends on somebody else. - Jujubee and Raven. Hit it. - Alright. Juju and I are gonna do dressed and undressed. - [RuPaul] Okay. Alright. (RuPaul chuckling) - Why the (beep) did I nominate myself to be naked? - I can see your penis. - [RuPaul] Give us that fashion, darling. High fashion, ladies. - I'm strugglin'. It's slippery. This (beep) is hard, girl. - [RuPaul] You are serving moon river. - I've got rain in my eyes. I've got rain in my shoes. I'm getting black rain in my brown flower. - This is the second time I've lost my lashes. (Shawn laughing) - Latrice Royale, Manila Luzon. - [Latrice] Ooh, you heard that crack? (RuPaul laughing) - Photo shoots, not my forte. We're gonna be wet on top of this? That's not glamorous, bitch. - [Manila] You okay? - Oh dear. - Ooh, I can't see. - Work through it, girl. Work through it. - Yes, you're a high fashion model. Black rain! Why it gotta be black? Couture meets cooter. Hurricane Latrice has just hit Manila. - Oh! Hallelujah! - Girl! Did I tell you? The challenge was kind of a hot mess, so this could be not good. - Will the following teams please step forward: Rujubee, Latrila. Your teams represent the very best of the week. Rujubee, your Half-Baked photo magnified your beauty, and your Opposites Attract photo, it really took balls. (queens laughing) Latrila, your Half-Baked photo is riveting, and your Opposites Attract photo is dripping with opulence. Latrice and Manila, you are the winners of this week's All-Star challenge. (Manila and Latrice cheering) - Bitch, work! Owww! Manila and I won the first challenge. Eat it! (Latrice laughing) - I have a question. We were in the Gold Bar talking about this. What's the beef between you and Alexis? (tense music) - I lost my job because of Mimi taking over my whole bar. I respect because it was not your decision, it was the bar owner, but I feel betrayed. I think, personally, I'm sorry, all these girls are better than you. (dramatic shady music) - But, but, but here's the thing, this was, if we're gonna get personal, we'll get personal. When any employer approaches any of us and says, "do you want this job, are you gonna take the job?" I had no idea that he let you go. And if you have a problem with it, you come to me first, girl. - No, I don't have a problem - - [Mimi] No, no, no - No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Shhh, I listened to you, and now you're gonna listen to me for one hot minute. - [Alexis] Okay. - This is my problem with it. - Act a fool, girl. - I'm here - (dramatic shady music) - Act a fool. - We are living in a world where people look at us like we're freaks. - Ha! Ha! I'm acting. - Why are we sitting here bullying each other? I think it's highly inappropriate. - [Shannel] No, baby. - [Manila] We're not bullying each other. - [Chad] We are not bulling. - [Manila] We are having an open discussion. This is not bullying. - Everybody shut up. - (beep) shenanigans. I did not sign up for this. - Wait a minute, how did you not know what you were signing up for? You already did this, girl. - Oh! Well, come on, Teletubbie, teleport us to Mars! - What the (beep)? Is, is this bitch for real? - I did not sign up for something... No. - [Chad] You started this (beep). - Change your costume, Mimi. Change your costume! Change it around! - I was feeling like Mimi's kind of turned over a new leaf, and then guess who came back? The old Mimi. - I just don't think it's appropriate to talk about (beep) that had nothing to do with anything that's happened here. - Well, guess what, Mimi? We did. You, Mimi Imfurst. Mimi Imfurst was number third in the voting? I could not believe it. Out of all 50 bitches - - Do not attack my fans, bitch. - Of the (beep) that I've seen, you don't have that many. So, out of 50 (beep) bitches that have been here, how did you manage that? - Because they need someone to go home first. - Ohhhhh! (queens laughing) - [Yara] And you know what? This thing is mad (beep) annoying, it's stupid. - [Tammie] Thank you. - [Yara] And do you know what? - [Chad] And there she goes again. - [Tammie] It's not very nice. - [Chad] Whatever. - You wanted crazy? Well, you got it now. - People are attacking me and it's just completely immature, childish shenanigans. These people should be ashamed of themselves. I'm done. - This challenge isn't about points, baby, it's about personality. Ooh, girl, I got this. - Alright, bitch, let's go. I want you to persuade people to loan you $5. - [Jujubee] Can I borrow $5? - [Raven] Not him. (RuPaul giggling) - Can I borrow $5? - Well, it depends, what do I get for it? - I'll give you a kiss on the cheek. - Okay. - Ooh. - We have seven minutes. - Let me see. I don't have five bucks. - He doesn't have $5. - Tell him he can put a foam hand on his hand and slap you in the face with it. - Will you put this on? - Alright. - Now, smack me with it. Smack me with it. - Ah! Thank you - (RuPaul giggling) - Oh, okay. (RuPaul laughing) We have four minutes. Get someone to moonwalk with you. - Will you moonwalk with me? - Moonwalk? - Yeah. - Okay. - Oh, oh, oh, oh - Oh, oh, oh. - Uh-huh. Woo hoo! - Three minutes left. - Okay, tell him to hit it. - Girl, really? - The next guy that walks by, I want you to try and get him to spray whipped cream down his pants. Grab them. - Do you mind if I spray whipped cream down your pants? - We have one minute and 30 seconds. - Can I spray whipped cream down your pants? - Sure. - Come here, baby! - Oh my gosh. - What? - Okay, go, bitch. Down it! Down. There you go. (whipped cream spraying) (RuPaul laughing) - Can I have a dollar? - [Guy] I actually don't have a dollar. (RuPaul laughing) - 15 seconds. Do the wave chain. - Will you hold my hand and go like this with me? - Ah, bitch, done, time's up. - Awww, time's up. You know, I feel like Raven and I did fantastically. And the whipped cream? Girl. - So, I'm out on the street on Hollywood Boulevard and all I'm thinking to myself is, "I have got 10 minutes, but I will do whatever it takes for Chad and I to win." What's goin' on? You're all just walking away. - Okay, convince someone to let you eat out of their hand. - Oh, I don't, oh, food, Food, food, food, food. How about grapes? - Go with the grapes, bitch. - Would you do me a favor really quick? Would you eat these grapes out of my hand, please? - Sure. - Ooh, yes. Eat 'em baby, eat 'em. - Other way around. You have to eat them out of his hand. - Oh, I gotta eat 'em out of your hand. Put 'em in your hand, let me eat 'em out of your hand. Okay. - That a girl. Suck it up, perfect. - You got lipstick on me. - Oh my God, amazing! Thank you so much! - Don't let him go, don't let him go. - Oh, wait, hang on, hang on. Hang on real quick. - Convince him. Cup their hands like a bowl, pour water in there, and drink it like a dog. - I'm gonna put this water in your hand real quick. Put the apples down real quick. - Yes, yes. - And I'm gonna drink the water out of your hand. - Like a dog. Lap it up, bitch, lap it up. (RuPaul laughing) Yes, bitch. - Oh, yeah! Thank you, thank you, thank you. - Persuade someone to dance with you. - How you doin'? Can we dance real quick? Let's dance, yes! Little bump and grind. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes! (RuPaul laughing) - Okay, listen up. Persuade someone to give you a foot massage. Can you give me a foot massage real quick? Ma'am, ma'am? Hi, sir, how are you? - Look at that girl run. - Would you massage my feet for like five seconds? - Oh my God. - Oh my God, it'll just take a second. Here, just massage my feet real quick. - Alright. - Oh, you better work, bitch. Yes! - [Shannel] That is so amazing. Thank you so much! - Convince someone to crack an egg on their forehead. - How are you, gorgeous? - How are you, baby? - Would you please crack this on your head for me, please? - Crack it on my head? - Yes, yes. And then I'll make sure it's all off of you. Please? - No way. - Come on, baby. - Work, work, work, work. - Crack, baby, come on. You can do it, you can do it, you can do it. - W-E-R-K, bitch. - You can do it. Yes! Thank you so much! - Yes, bitch! - Get her to cluck like a chicken. Get her to cluck like a chicken. - Would you cluck like a chicken real quick? Bock, bock, bock, bock, bock! Yay! - Time's out, baby. Good job. - Oh my God. We have to read each other in a cheer form, and we have, like, 20 minutes to prepare for this (beep). It's impossible. - Do we have to say it together? - Yes. - Okay. Raven and I are very excited for this mini challenge because that's what we do. We read to filth. - All of us look hysterical. Raven looked like the football team put his ass up in drag. - Shannel, what is goin' on with your face? You are painting for the blind. - Alright, ladies, time's up. First up, Team Yarlexis. - Whoooo! - [Yarlexis] Five, six, seven, eight, Raven, Raven, slow and sleek, you so boring I fall asleep.

We have to come up with superpowers. a mission, our backstories, as well as costumes. It is a lot. Obviously I'm gonna be the villain. - Well, yeah. - I am taller, and usually the villain is taller. - Bigger. Manlier. - Yeah, more butch. - Yeah. - I'll take that. - Of course I'm the superhero. Duh. - I think I'll do the villain. - Cause you can give 'em cold shoulders and icy stares. - I'm gonna be playing the villain. Chad will be the superhero. He's the pretty, you know, the Disney bitch. And I'm just, just an evil (beep). - Here's the thing. We gotta keep this funny. Here's what I'm thinking for my superhero. Fire (beep). And I am in charge of vaginal rejuvenations. - Really? - What was your idea? - I was thinking of more like, like, like a black diamondy, something like, you know, the stealer of the rarest black diamonds in the world. - Let me tell you something. When I competed before, there was an individual who got a challenge and insisted on taking a serious approach to it, and she was sent home that night. We need to make them laugh. - We do. - Maybe your tits put out my fire. That's my weakness. (Chad imitating milk gushing) And then, ohh! Sickening. What I'm thinking, red pubic hair creeping out either side of the thing, girl. - Chad's ideas are dirty and raunchy. I'm just a little bit nervous. - [Chad] My name is Chadissa Michaels. - [Santino] Ooh. - [RuPaul] Gorgeous. - [Michelle] Lady in red. - [Chad] I'm from Little Cooch, Arkansas. While working the sugar walls clinic, a chemical contaminant infused me with super tightening powers of vaginal rejuvenation. - [Judges] Oooh. - [Santino] Work that dress, mama. - [Chad] By day, I'm an esthetician, but at night I transform into FireCrotch! - [Michelle] Wow. - [RuPaul] She's a torch slinger. - [Chad] My mission is to keep the sugar walls of the world tight and right. - [RuPaul] Yes. (Judges gasping) - [Chad] My super powers are flying, coochie-lifting lasers, and hot Brazilian waxes. - [RuPaul] Call FEMA, cause her coochie's on fire. - [Michelle] They won't show up. (RuPaul laughing) - [Chad] To activate my superpowers, I say, Don't hesitate, vaginal rejuvenate! - [RuPaul] What a flamer. - [Shannel] My name is Shannel Suits. I grew up in Nipple Junction, Tennessee. While working in a hospital lab, radiation infused my brain with magnetic lactation abilities. - [RuPaul] Black widow. - [Santino] Kiss of the spider woman. - [Shannel] By day, I'm a mammographer. But at night, I transform into Lactasia! (laser blasting) - [RuPaul] Oh yes! - [Santino] Pure evil. - [Shannel] My master plan is to douse the FireCrotch's mission. My powers are supersonic speed, and death rays from my breasts. - Ooh, getting a little nippy in here, isn't it? - [RuPaul] Yes, it is. - [Shannel] I activate my evil powers by saying, areolas activate! Hard nipples lactate! - [Judges] Oooooh. - [Michelle] Tweak it. (Shannel cackling evilly) - [Jujubee] My name is Jujubee. I'm from the planets Solaris. - [RuPaul] Miss Laos in the house. - [Jujubee] A solar eclipse shot Solaris to earth, causing me to become a bronze goddess. - [Michelle] Bronze beauty. - [RuPaul] Glamorama! - [Jujubee] By day, I'm a beauty consultant. But, at night I transform into, Melanina. - [Elvira] Oh, I love the hairdryer. - [RuPaul] Yes. - [Jujubee] My super powers are the magical TS gun, Tan Spray. To activate my superpowers, I say, no tea, no shade. - [RuPaul] She blinded me with science. - [Santino] That's her sun gun. - [Michelle] And those are her sun buns. - [Jujubee] My mission is to bring a bronze glow to every human being. Fierce, solid color. - [RuPaul] Gingersnap. - [Raven] My name is Raven. I grew up on the planet Solaris. - [Santino] Oooh, hoochie. - [Raven] One day, my planet shot to the earth during a solar eclipse, causing me to lose all pigment in my skin. - [RuPaul] Taylor Dayne in the house. - [Santino] Tell it to my heart. - [RuPaul] "Tell It To My Heart" only told half the story. - [Michelle] Her ass tells the rest. - [RuPaul] Yes. - [Raven] By day, I'm a fashion photographer, but at night, I transform into Sophia Fierce. - [RuPaul] Oh wow, something wicked this way comes. - [Raven] My master plan is to dominate the world by throwing shade from the cuffs on my wrist. - [Elvira] Power cuffs. - [RuPaul] Yes, the cuffs of doom. - [Raven] I activate my evil powers by saying, throw me shade, bitch! - [Santino] Oooh. - [Michelle] She's got some haunted hills right behind her. - [RuPaul] Uh-huh. - [Raven] This is a battle of good versus evil and I'm going to win. - [Judges] Wow. - Shannel and Chad, you are the winners of this week's challenge. - [Chad] Thank you, judges, thank you Ru. - [Shannel] So much. - Raven and Jujubee, I'm sorry, my dears, but you are up for elimination. - Raven is my dear friend and I do not wanna lip sync against him, but at the same time, I don't wanna go home. - Two queens stand before me. Ladies, this is your last chance to impress me and to save yourselves from elimination. The time has come for you to lip sync for your life. - I do not wanna have to lip sync against Juju, but I'm gonna fight for my spot to stay in this competition. (Raven gasping sadly) - Good luck, and don't (beep) it up. ♪ Somebody said you got a new friend ♪ ♪ Does she love you better than I can? ♪ ♪ Yeah, I know it's stupid ♪ ♪ I just gotta see it for myself ♪ ♪ I'm in the corner ♪ ♪ Watching you kiss her ♪ ♪ Ohh-Ohhh ♪ ♪ I'm right over here ♪ ♪ Why can't you see me? ♪ ♪ Ohh-Ohhh ♪ ♪ I'm giving it my all ♪ ♪ But I'm not the girl you're taking home ♪ ♪ Oooh-Oooh ♪ ♪ I keep dancing on my own ♪ ♪ I keep dancing on my own ♪ ♪ I'm just gonna dance all night ♪ ♪ Stilettos and broken bottles ♪ ♪ I'm spinning around in circles ♪ ♪ I'm in the corner ♪ ♪ Watching you kiss her ♪ ♪ Ohh-Ohhh ♪ ♪ I'm giving it my all ♪ ♪ But I'm not the girl you're taking home ♪ ♪ Ooh-Ooh ♪ ♪ I keep dancing on my own ♪ ♪ I keep dancing on my own ♪ (Judges applauding) (Jujubee sobbing) (Jujubee breathing heavily) - I, I can't breathe. (dramatic music) (Jujubee breathing heavily) - [RuPaul] Raven, would you help her? Thank you, Raven. - [Jujubee] I didn't wanna do that. What the (beep). - [Raven] Can you stand? - I can do it, I'm sorry. - [RuPaul] Alright, we're gonna continue. - [Jujubee] I'm sorry. You look so pretty. - [Raven] So do you. - Thank you. Okay, okay. I got it. (dramatic music) - Ladies, I've made my decision. You leave me no choice. Raven, Jujubee, shantay you both stay. - [Chad] Yes! Yes! - Thank you so much. (Raven laughing) - I say (beep) it, we have a top four. (Chad laughing) - I want fried chicken now. (RuPaul giggling) (upbeat funky music) - Oh my God. - Hello! (audience applauding) Are you ready for an All-Star comedy review? (audience cheering) - Everyone is so terrified and it's scary. We only have five minutes. - [RuPaul] Give a warm Hollywood welcome to Jujubee! (audience applauding) - Hi! - Hi. - I'm so nervous right now. It's the final challenge, anybody could win. Hopefully it's me. (audience applauding) (bell dinging) So, first things first, right? I was born a drag queen and the afterbirth was glitter. (audience laughing) When I came out, I had a Mac lip gloss in one hand, the other one was a jazz hand! Everybody do a jazz hand with me, darling. Whoo! So, basically I pop out and they named me Airline. I mean, my parents must've been on some good shit. (audience laughing) The funniest part about my name, really, is that my grandma can't say it. Picture this, okay? Old Asian lady. Titties down to here. Ay-len. (audience laughing) Ay-len, I come home and all I see, wigs, undywear, panty, Blue Paul CD, I don't know. What is going on with your head? (audience laughing) Are you gay? Well, kind of. (audience laughing) Ay-len, look in my face. You pucking liar, you go out with boy! (audience cheering) (bell dinging) You know, I feel really confident. I hope that crown is nice and heavy and shiny. - [Announcer] Up next, Chad Michaels! - How's everybody doing? (audience cheering) (bell dinging) Thank you. I am from San Diego, California, the meth capital of the world. And I'm really happy to be here, ladies and gentlemen. (audience applauding) So, you know, I'm 41 years old, and I am a self-proclaimed drag cougar. (Chad purring like a cougar) I have resorted to plastic surgery to maintain my looks. And as I said, I'm from San Diego, which is only a short 20-minute drive from the finest surgeons that Tijuana has to offer. (audience laughing) Don't think for one minute that I have not taken advantage of those Fiesta Day blowout deals on silicone. (Chad exclaiming excitedly) Fill 'em up, Pepe, honey. (audience laughing) And my doctor, Dr. Bendito, finally gave me cheeks that I can see. Literally, I can see them. (audience laughing) It is very distracting, but, it's a rough road. (Chad pretending to cry) - [RuPaul] Awwww. (bell dinging) - I mean, you guys think that these are my tits, and they're not. They're my balls, I just pushed them up, they're hanging so low. (audience laughing) You guys are wonderful, I wanna thank you guys so much. You've been a fantastic audience. (audience cheering) Oh my God, I went over. (beep). - [Announcer] And now, Raven! (bell dinging) - Hi everybody. (audience cheering) Well, I apologize, first of all, for my outfit. It's laundry day. (audience laughing) And that's probably why I'm single. You know, I do have relationships and they usually last a couple hours. (audience laughing) My relationships usually end unconventionally, either it's last call, security flashes their light in your car, or the warden comes and tells you you've been released. (audience laughing) Anyone been to jail in here? Prostitution, right? (audience laughing) So, I go to jail, and I met the man of my dreams. And it is true love. This a 25-hour relationship. (audience laughing) I never got his name, cause who cares? So I'm gonna call him Anfrony. Cause I like that name. And when you get drunk it sounds like it should be pronounced, Anthony. So, we meet in the same cell, so we already were off to a good start. I'm feeling him, and he's trying to feel on me. And I told him, look, you wanna feel on me, you better get me a drink. That's how I usually do it, that's how we're gonna do it up in jail. So, he decided to take me over to his bunk, and he sleeps on the top, so, match made in heaven. And then, the warden came and took me and said you've got to go home. So what did I do? I looked at him and I said, "peace out, bitch, I gotta go." (audience laughing) (audience applauding) (bell dinging) I am having a blast. I want another five minutes. - [Announcer] Up next, Shannel! (bell dinging) - What's up? People say to me all the time, "Shannel, why you got such judgemental eyebrows, bitch?" I said, "judgemental eyebrows, baby, maybe you just real insecure, honey." Booboo, when I had looked up in the mirror this morning, I got real scared, real quick. Look at this hair! This is the Charmin bear that had exploded right up all over my hair, honey. (audience laughing) I had stuck my finger into the light socket - (Shannel imitating being electrocuted) How many of y'all out here wear pantyhose? As a drag queen, my issue with pantyhose is there's no room for a penis. (audience laughing) (bell dinging) - You guys have been an amazing audience. (audience cheering) That was so (beep) awesome. I am getting into the Drag Race Hall of Fame. - [RuPaul] First up, Chad Michaels. - [Michelle] Wow. - [Chad] This is Chad Michaels, the drag warrior that never gives up and never will. - [RuPaul] Faster pussycat, stomp, stomp. - [Santino] Holo-graphic. - [Cheri] Chitty-Chitty Chad-Bang. - [RuPaul] Oh yeah. Jujubee! Touch this skin, honey. - [Jujubee] I'm serving you up some fierce, sexy, sultry diva. - [RuPaul] Ooh, it looks like a blue moon tonight. - [Michelle] Uh-huh, she must live in Ass-bury Park. (Judges laughing) - [RuPaul] Shannel. - [Shannel] I am serving red Cirque du Solei realness. - [Michelle] She's giving you crustacean couture, honey. - [RuPaul] Yes, honey. Raven. - [Judges] Oooh. - [Raven] I'm giving quintessential Raven. This is my moment. - [RuPaul] That's so Raven. - [Santino] Boudoir. - [RuPaul] Street corner booty. (Judges laughing) Sweet dreams. Welcome back, ladies. Based on your performance in this week's challenge, during this entire competition, and throughout your All-Star careers, I've made some decisions. (dramatic music) You are all my legendary children, but, there's room for just one inductee to the Drag Race Hall of Fame. Shannel, Jujubee, I'm sorry, my dears, but this is not your moment. (dramatic music) - This is heartbreaking. I don't know what to feel. - I am so devastated. You put your heart and your soul into what you do, and sometimes it's just not good enough. - Keep believing in yourselves with all your hearts. Please step to the back of the stage. Two All-Stars stand before me. Ladies, this is your last chance to impress me and prove to the world that you are worthy of entering the Drag Race Hall of Fame. - [Raven] I'm standing in the same place I was standing last time I was here. I'm shaking, my mouth is dry, and I start to feel so nervous. I have to turn it out. - The time has come for you to lip sync for your life. - [Chad] I know I have to put my whole heart and soul into this lip sync. - Good luck, and don't (beep) it up. ♪ If I had a dime every time they said, girl ♪ ♪ I think I'd have a million ♪ - [Chad] This is 20 years of experience all down to one moment and I'm owning this. ♪ A negative opinion ♪ ♪ On my own, I had to learn it, learn it ♪ - [Raven] I'm doing what I wanna do, and that's be sexy, fierce, gorgeous, and glamorous, and make sure all eyes are on me. ♪ It's your responsi-trannity ♪ ♪ Don't forget, don't forget-get who you are ♪ ♪ Yes it's true, true for all of you ♪ ♪ We are all-stars, we are all stars ♪ ♪ When I close my eyes ♪ ♪ Voices in my head ♪ ♪ Sound more appealing ♪ ♪ Constantly remind me of what he said ♪ ♪ He said, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't stop believing ♪ ♪ It's your responsi-trannity ♪ ♪ Don't forget, don't forget-get who you are ♪ ♪ Yes it's true, true for all of you ♪ ♪ We are all-stars, we are all stars ♪ (Judges applauding) - Ugh! - Ladies, (dramatic music) I've made my decision. The winner of RuPaul's Drag Race All-Stars, the first inductee to the Drag Race Hall of Fame is Chad Michaels. (Chad crying) (Judges applauding) - Oh my God. Thank you, Ru. - My queen, this crown belongs to not only you but to the millions of fans that you inspire. And remember, if you can't love yourself how in the hell you gon' love somebody else? Can I get an amen up in here? - Amen! (upbeat music) - Oh don't mind me. I'm just here to sweep up the competition, girl. I am Monet X Change, and you better get your currency in check, bitch. Oh my god, what the (bleep)? - It's Monet. - Cracker! Miz Cracker! Monet is a very fun, effervescent personality. Charming. Any single men out there, I'm very charming. - What kind of drag do you do? - I'm eclectic, I'm eccentric. - Versatile? - Versatile. - Good. - I like that. - Eureka, you're not versatile. (Monet laughs) - [RuPaul] Monet X Change. Ooh, Monet changes everything. - Yas, Monet. - Yas! - Monet X Change, she looks like a million bucks. Her body looks great. She's giving you high energy. She is turning it. - [Queen] Yas! - I am channeling my inner "Paris is Burning." I'm just gonna feel my oats, and I dip like three times in a row, boom. - Oh! - Boom, boom! (queens laughing) Monet X Change is not here to play. - Now on the runway, y'all snatched our attention, but one of you scored a perfect 10. (dramatic music) Monet X Change, you're the winner of this season's first mini challenge. (queens cheering) - Yes bitch, I won the first mini challenge of season 10. I'm here to let these girls know, don't (bleep) with New York City. Yeah, we won last season, and we gonna win again. (Monet laughs) - Now ladies, to kick off a new decade of drag, we're going back to our roots. As in, back to the very first challenge from the very first episode of "RuPaul's Drag Race." We call it drag on a dime. (queens cheering) - I think I've reneged on the Barbie dolls, if anyone wants the Barbie dolls. - Here, bitch. 'Cause I don't think I'm gonna have enough for the flowers. - My first idea is to do this doll constructed thing, but I realize that there aren't enough to cover my bigass body. And I know that I can create this really Gaga couture-esque look with sponges. It's either gonna be couture or cou-torn. - [RuPaul] Monet X Change. - [Ross] Cleanup on season 10. (RuPaul laughs) - My look is very conceptual, and there's like a whole story with the dirt in my eyes, and I have ping pong balls to make little soap suds, and I have blue earrings to signify the water. I'm literally cleaning the floor with my garment as I'm walking down the runway, and it's (bleep) fierce. - [Carson] Oh god, she's so self-absorbent. - Yeah. - That is Brillo-iant. (judges laughing) - [RuPaul] Where are you from, Monet? - I'm an Irish girl. - [RuPaul] Oh, what part of Ireland? - Northern Ireland? (queens laugh) - [RuPaul] Can you dance an Irish jig? - Oh sure, yeah. An Irish jig, girl. Just gotta jig it. Oh yeah, girl. - [RuPaul] Sing something Irish to the chocolate. (singing in foreign language) (queens laughing) Hey, Kit Kats. - Hey. - Hi. - Three of you really made me snicker. Blair St. Clair. (queens clapping) Monique Heart. - Yes! (queens clapping) - And Monet X Change. - Yeah! (queens clapping) - Monet, I am sorry my dear, but you are up for elimination. - I feel like my entire drag career is flashing before my eyes. I'm gonna have to lip sync for my life against my New York city sister, but I want them to know that I'm this fierce drag queen and I wanna be here. - Two queens stand before me. Ladies, this is your last chance to impress me, and save yourself from elimination. The time has come (thunder booms) for you to lip sync for your life!

You may join the other girls. - [Monet] Thank you, Ru. - Monet, Mayhem, I'm sorry my dears, but you are up for elimination. - For me to be in the bottom two a second week in a row, it is so disheartening. It feels like Ru has wasted a ticket here to "RuPaul's Drag Race," and I should not be here. - Two queens stand before me. Prior to tonight, you were asked to prepare a lip sync performance of "Man, I Feel Like a Woman" by Shania Twain. Ladies, this is your last chance to impress me, and save yourself from elimination.

Author, actress, and a national treasure, Maya Angelou. - Hello, RuPaul. Do you know why the caged bird sings? - I've always wanted to know. Why does the caged bird sing? - Because Mariah Carey lost the key. (audience laughs) - Ooh, the shade comin' from Miss Maya Angelou this evening. All right, now here we go. Kate, did ya hear about the new smartphone for drag queens? Instead of face recognition, it recognizes your blank. Looks like Beyonce's writing. - This is the first time Beyonce's ever written for herself. - Oh. - Watch it, toots. - [RuPaul] All right, Kate Upton. - Charisma, uniqueness, nerve, and talent. - Oh, that's a great answer. Let's see if you matched any of the stars. Maya Angelou. Maya Angelou, new smart, are you asleep? - No, sorry, I was resting my eyes. - I see, okay. Did ya hear about the new smartphone for drag queens? Instead of face recognition, it recognizes your? - Well, RuPaul, I've written 17 books, 19 plays, 13 autobiographies, and two Hallmark cards. (audience laughs) And it recognizes you're a phenomenal woman. - You're a phenomenal woman. Almost! All right, this next one's for Audra McDonald. Martha Stewart is a really bad influence on Snoop Dogg. Now when he makes brownies, he puts blank in them. (plucky music) - He puts parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme. - Scarborough Fair. It's a really good song. Sounds like some awful brownies. - [Audra] Yes. - All right, let's move on down to Maya Angelou. - Well, RuPaul, before I answer the question, these women seem very hostile and I wrote a soliloquy to inform them. - Oh, I'd love to hear it. We have nothing but time here. (audience laughs) - If these hoes try to come for me, I surely will cut thee. I will not hesitate to put thou in a ditch, because Maya Angelou ain't no punk bitch. (audience laughs) - Oh it rhymes, it rhymes! - All right, but did you write an answer to this? - I would put my underwire in a brownie, 'cause I don't have any support here. - Oh, underwire. Unfortunately, Audra, it's not a match. - It's still not a match, but it's good. - [RuPaul] Monet X Change. - [Judge] Battlestar Gill-actica. (judges laughing) - Tuna Turner. (judges laughing) - [Monet] I'm giving you beat up tattered warrior mermaid, 'cause I'm here to fight these bitches to the top. Monet is a strong, powerful warrior mermaid fish. - [RuPaul] You wanna talk about the deadliest snatch? (judges laughing) - [Judge] Stop polluting our oceans! (RuPaul laughs) - Monet X Change. - Hello, Ru! - Monet, Monet, Monet. Is that your lacefront? - This was actually the very first, like before I even started drag, and I went to this store in SoHo, and I found this wig and I've never parted ways with it. - But have you worn it in this competition? - Oh no, no, never here, never here. - That is a mistake. I know you love them pussycat wigs, but bitch, you know what? You need to wear some bigass hair, because you got that big, fat, juicy ass. - Yeah. - Six girls are left in this competition, down to the wire. - Yes. - How are you gonna make it to the finish line? - Well I'm gonna slay this acting challenge today. I feel like I've been on a steady upward climb in the past- - You haven't won any challenges, though. - I know! - What's wrong with that? - You know, I think it's just, I mean I'm doing well in the Maxi Challenges, but it's following through on the runway and really giving y'all something to gag over. - You know they say you have lots of breaks that happen in your life, you just have to be prepared for them. - Yes. - This is yours to go and get. - Amen, Ru. - Make sure you get this. - Yes, I will, I swear I am. I will, Ru. - I'll see you out there. - Thank you, thank you. - [Miz Cracker] Monet, you were in Portland for a while, right? - I sure was. - You remember that drag queen that was like, 96? - Darcelle! - Yes, ma'am. - Yes, she is the oldest drag queen I know. - I think she's the oldest drag queen in America. - Right? - Besides Shequida. - [Monet] It was so cool to go watch the show, 'cause to see she is up there in her heels. - Telling the jokes that are exactly her age. (Monet laughs) I just flew in from Portland, and boy are my arms tired. (Monet laughs) - You know, I see myself doing drag forever, girl. I'm gonna be Miss Darcelle one day, just me, but I ain't wearing no heels though. I'll be in some good Toms, and a little kitten wig, RuPaul. - [RuPaul] Monet X Change. Ooh girl, you better sissy that walker. (judges laughing) (judges gasping) - I feel like when I age, I'm gonna be a mess. I did not take care of myself, I don't have health insurance. But I'm still gonna keep on having fun with drag. So, instead of having the IV drip, I have little bags of liquor on there. I'm playing hacky sack with my titties and I'm having a good ol' time with this look. - [RuPaul] She's gonna be on this month's cover of Elle-der Care. (judges laughing) What's your name? - Randy. - Are you Randy? - I am Randy the woodchuck. (RuPaul laughs) All tea, all trade. - Yeah, you got a little twist in your hip there. Can you take that out? - All tea, all trade. (RuPaul giggles) - You're giving it a little twist at the end that's kind of like, hey. - Oh (bleep) I gotta slap that (bleep) outta me. - [RuPaul] Yeah yeah, get that outta there. - All tea, all trade. - Can you put one hand on, between way down there. - Down here, well it's real long. Gotta get down there. - I think you could be America's next chop model. You know they say that social media is taking over the world, but this week, "RuPaul's Drag Race" is gonna take over the whole internet. Say hello to some of today's hottest social media stars. (dramatic music) (queens squealing) Tyler Oakley. - I'm so happy that you're here! - Thank you. - I'm happy that I get to make you over into a fabulous drag queen. - I am, like this is legitimate bucket list (bleep). - I'm really happy that I get Tyler Oakley. He's very like, free-spirited. He is down for anything. So, I need to know, have you ever done drag before? - I have never performed, but I've gotten my face done. - Have you ever walked in heels? (Monet laughs) So you know my name is Monet X Change. You're Tyler Oakley, you're short. What do you think of? This is just, I'm just throwing out, just thought about it, Short Change? - Short Change? (both laughing) I love it, I love it, I love it. - I am the only X Change that exists in the world. My tubes have been tied up until this point, so he should feel very lucky and privileged that he's part of the House of X Change, darling. - I love it. - Do you? - Yes, yeah! - [Monet] I wanna see this walk. Let me see what- - No, you can't make me do that. - Oh no, oh we are taking you all the way out of your comfort zone. Tyler has never really worn heels before, and um, he is trying his best. I believe in you, Short Change. - Okay, okay. - Oh, careful. You are walking down Fifth Avenue. - [Tyler] I think actually, hello! - All right, Miss Short Change! For the most part, he has it somewhat together. You're gliding, oh! Girl. (Monet chuckles) (Tyler laughs) Any guy who starts walking in heels for the first time, they always do like the fierce face. They have to do like the. And you try to do that in the heels, and I'm like no girl, do not do all that. Being sexy on the runway and having fun is what's really gonna give the essence of the X Change family secret. - You know, you've come under fire about your aesthetic. - That's why we got some big hair today. We gonna get some big hair up in this gig, Ru. - No pussycat wigs. - [Monet] No pussycat wigs. - Ah-ah, you save that for Sunday service. - What is with Ru and my pussycat wigs? I don't get it. He gonna gag when I come out with my own line of sponge pussycat wigs. Available on iTunes. - All right, I'll see you out there. - Thank you, Ru. - Thank you, Ru. - Short Change. - Short Change. (both laughing) - [RuPaul] Up next, Monet X Change and Short Change. - Okay! - Ooh. - [Judge] Break it up, break it up. - [RuPaul] That's right, dollar bills y'all. - [Ross] I always forget, which one's Tia and which one's Tamera? (judges laughing) - Big hair don't care, girl. It is a Friday night, we just got paid. We don't even go home and shower. I'm taking her out, it's Miss Short Change's 21st birthday. We both got our glasses on, 'cause we gotta see the ugly dudes at the club, and she's so excited. Yes, Short Change is living her life, girl. She is feelin' it, and at the end of the day that is all that matters, period. - [RuPaul] They got they reading glasses on. - [Michelle] It's time to go back to the library. (judges laughing) - Monet X Change, and Short Change. (Tyler giggles) - Short Change, you look thick as (bleep). - Thank you. Down with the thickness. (judges laughing) - I do wanna take this moment to tell you, Monet, how stunningly beautiful you look tonight. Why would you ever go back to your pussycat wig? - Pussycat wigs, Jesus Christ. - And I really enjoyed seeing Tyler, 'cause he was having a good time. - I had the most fun. - But, doesn't mean the job that you were supposed to do was done, because there is no family resemblance apart from a pair of glasses. I felt like you were taking your co-worker, who never gets out, and you dressed her up and you were like, come on Stacy. We gonna go out to the local gay bar, go see a drag show. - I was thinking like, you just met working the same car show. And you're like, oh my god, we both look great in the uniform. Let's go spend some of our money. - Her makeup's not the best either, Monet. Her brows are a little crazy from here. - I feel beautiful. - I'm glad you do, darlin'. - God bless. - I mean, zero family resemblance. - Monet, I'm sorry my dear, but you are up for elimination. - I feel so, so bad that I am here for the third time, but I am not a give up gal. I am a fierce performer, and a fierce entertainer, and I'm not giving up. - Two queens stand before me. Prior to tonight, you were asked to prepare a lip sync performance of "Good As Hell" by Lizzo. Ladies, this is your last chance to impress me, and save yourself from elimination. (tense music) The time has come (thunder rumbles) for you to lip sync for your life! - Performing is my passion.

I am Monet X Change of season 10, your current reigning Miss Congeniality. I am here to slay, and until I snatch that crown, a bitch brought her own, ooh. Soak it up, bitches! - [RuPaul] Monet X Change. - [Michelle] Monet is on a roll. - Maya Angelou ain't no punk bitch. (audience laughs) In season 10, I thought I was going all the way. - The looks seem homemade, really sloppy. - If I could go back in time, one thing I would change for my season would be my rickety crickety runways, girl. So I can have some challenge wins! I want a challenge win! Ooh, RuPaul, but I'm Miss Congeniality. I could never! Here we go, bitch.

It was another memorable moment for me from tonight as well. - But now let's talk about this runway look. I love it! - Okay, I was about to say damn, girl! (Valentina laughs) - This is a look that you never would've served us on season 10, and look at you now. It's a joy to watch you really hone your skills. - Thank you. - Thank you, ladies. I think we've heard enough. And, I've made some decisions. (tense music) Monet X Change. Valentina. Condragulations, you are the top two All Stars of the week. (all applauding) (tense music) Welcome back, ladies. Two top All Stars stand before me. Prior to tonight, you were asked to prepare a lip sync performance of "Into You" by Ariana Grande.

(people sobbing) (emotional music) - Well I just hope Lady Bunny's in a better place. - Trust me, she is. I've seen her apartment. Friends and loved ones, to pay tribute to the Lady Bunny, please welcome Monet X Change. (audience laughs) - Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to celebrate the life, liberty, and illiteracy of our dear friend, Lady Bunny. (audience laughs) Many know her as Lady Bunny, but I like to go by her original drag name, Methuselah. (audience laughs) Or as they know her down at the clinic, Patient Zero. (audience laughs) She was often called the Beyonce of drag, not because she was rich and beautiful or famous, but because she looked like she was carrying twins. (audience laughs) Look at that big bloated bitch in that box. (audience laughs) Have you ever seen her out of drag? Anybody? Category is Ben Franklin (bleep) the Michelin Man, amen. (audience laughs) You know, this reminds me of a story when we all went on tour. Bunny expressed that she wanted to eat a little Mexican. Poor little Valentina didn't stand a chance. (audience laughs) ♪ She's a super queen, super queen ♪ - Category is, angelic white. First up, Monet X Change. - [Judge] Someone's gotta tell her she's got toilet paper on her shoe. (judges laughing) - I am bringing my own runway to the runway. This little train, ha, whatever bitch. (judges oohing) I'm so (bleep) over these bitches that I am stigmata'd the house down boots. I feel like I'm giving you Saint X Change. - [Ross] Another bleeding heart liberal. (judges laughing) - [Michelle] Thank god. Forgive me Father, for I have stunned. (judges laughing) - Say three hail Marys and call me in the morning. (judges laughing) Welcome, ladies. It's time for the judges critiques. Starting with Monet X Change. - When you came out, the first thing I wrote was fierce, and then I wrote fearless. And that's what I got from the whole time that you were speaking about Lady Bunny. - Girl, you were funny. - Thank you. - It was a joy to watch you, because you had the audience in the palm of your hand 'cause you came out strong, and every single time you delivered. - You had so many jokes, just in terms of hard jokes, you had the most tonight. And I thought you were not just reciting them, you were still staying present to bounce off what was happening in the moment. Just so many good jokes, I'm jealous. - Thank you. - Sometimes when it comes to the main stage, I worry about Monet X Change, not gonna lie. Tonight you have elevated your look. This is a beautiful interpretation of angelic white. The beadwork is extraordinary, it fits your body. The headpiece, the inclusion of hair. You almost rented your own runway back there, the train. It was just all really beautiful. - Thank you. - I'm proud of you, Monet. - Thank you, Michelle. - [Michelle] Keep it up, don't let me down. - I will not. - Based on your performances in the roast, and on the runway, I've made some decisions. Manila Luzon, Monet X Change, condragulations, you are the top two All Stars of the week. (all applauding) (upbeat music) You'll be making over your best Judys. (Monet yelps) - What? - My heart just sank, bitch. - And here they are. Monet's best Judy, Patty. (Monet screams) - Little Patty! - You don't call, you don't text! - Patty, get over here, Patty! - Everybody's so hairy. - Wait, but did you miss me actually? - I really did! Girl, I see you every day. - I like literally have just been sitting at home doing nothing. - Lies! - No, seriously. I'm like I'm (bleep), I've watched everything I can possibly watch on Netflix. - I (bleep) love Patty. Patty is not just one of my best friends, he's also my assistant. Patty knows some secrets, girl, that we don't tell nobody, okay? So boom, so take her and her. Let me get the other ones. This makeover challenge is scary. I would be lying if I told you that I was excited, that I knew I was gonna turn the party, 'cause I don't. The fact of the matter is, this challenge sent me home last time. Last season, girl, you know this was my downfall. - There is no family resemblance, apart from a pair of glasses. - So if I don't do well, it's your fault. (Patty laughs) Girl. Me and Patty are just so vastly different. I'm 5'11", she's 5'4". I'm Black as hell, she white as hell. There is nothing that Patty and I have that resemble each other. We both might be gay, that's about it. - I'm like, nervous though. I can't (bleep) this up. (Monet laughs) Do you know what I mean? - I know. - Hi Monet, hi Patty. - Hi Ru! - Hi. - Is Patty short for Patrick? - Yes. - Top of the morning to ya, Patrick. (Monet laughs) (Irish music) How'd y'all meet again? - Bob the Drag Queen introduced us, and when you launched my star on "RuPaul's Drag Race," Patty has been traveling with me around the world, and around the country. - Oh really, so this is a makeover challenge, bitch you know. - Girl, Ru. - Oh girl, you know it was a makeover challenge that sent your Black ass home last time. - PTSD, girl. - What are you gonna do to make sure that you are not holding that Tweeterhead maquette at the end of this challenge? - I really wanna make sure that we look like family, and sell that fantasy that we were birthed from the same vagina. We are getting a razor, and we are shaving them brows off. You can grow them back- - You're gonna shave the brows off? - Absolutely. - You know, I came in like really willing to do whatever- - We are dedicated to the cause, Ru. - 'Cause you shave yours off. - I sure do. - Yeah, shave that (bleep) off. It grows back! - I'm gonna be single a little bit longer. - That's right, right. All right, well listen, I can't wait to see y'all out there. - Thank you, Ru. - Do it for Judy. - Amen. - All right, see you later. - [Monet] Thank you, Ru. ♪ We're losing eyebrows today ♪ - [Monique] You're gonna do it? - Are you really gonna shave 'em off? - Yeah! - Do y'all remember "Powder?" The movie, the little white boy with no, do y'all remem, go Google it. ♪ Shaving the face ♪ - Just sayin'. - Can't we get rid of my mustache first? (queens laughing) - All right, here we go, turn this way a little bit. - If you cut me, bitch, I swear to God. - I'm not gonna cut you. - I swear to God. - I promise I won't. - Oh my god, I'm so gagged. You look so cute! - [Patty] I'm gonna look like an alien. (clippers buzzing) - I have always hated Patty's mustache, so it is a pleasure to whack it off. You look like, 70 years old.

(judges laughing) - We are serving New York City's finest. She's giving you a little Dita Von Teese, I'm giving you a little Black chocolate Judy Garland, honey. We look good. I feel like we look expensive, and we both have the X Change family secret. A big ol' booty. - [Michelle] There's gold in them there cheeks. (judges laughing) - Up next, Monet X Change and Patty Cash. Cha-ching. (both laugh) - Monet, you've never looked more gorgeous. I just thought this was really a great winning, twinning look. - Thank you. - Let's get to your performance. (tense music) It was so brilliant. - Oh, I was about to say, oh god. - You had the aura, the essence, the steps, the faces, the little Judy-isms. They were all there. I had chills, I don't get chills. - Maybe it's menopause. - Maybe. (all laughing) - I really loved it. I enjoyed every moment. Watching you guys, I soaked it all in. - Michelle, you see? - No more sponges. Frances, don't encourage her. - Monet X Change. Naomi Smalls. Condragulations, you are the top two All Stars of the week. (upbeat music) - I think I wanna talk about, like having superpowers, but also tying it into the games, you know what I mean? Which is really fierce. - Right. - What? (Monet laughs) - I think that these queens should be worried. You know, I can dance, I can sing, and I'm a good lyricist, girl. I have a song on iTunes that has over a million hits, girl. I'm a superstar queen. What do you feel? - I just want this due. Like, I wanna be top two. I would love it if it was us two. - I would live. - I feel like for one of us to win, it would be like you didn't see us coming, you know what I mean? And we showed the (bleep) out. - Monique and I have been so underestimated this entire season, because we're so fresh from season 10, but we were able to come back in and do this immediately, and really slay this competition. This is so crazy. - Hi, Monet. - Hello Ru and Michelle! - [RuPaul] Monet X Change. - Oh bitch, full circle moment, honey. My season, I didn't get to do a podcast with Ru, so I am excited, I'm elated, girl. What's the tea, bitch? - The sponge has landed. (Monet laughs) - I did it just for Michelle. - Hope you mop up the competition. (all laughing) - So you know, this is your first time at the podcast. - It is, Ru. - Because you didn't make it this far last time. - I did not, and I feel a lot of shame. Season 10, I left with my tail between my legs, you know? - You didn't need to do that, though. You did a good job. You were loved, you were Miss Congeniality. - I think the shame for me came with New York City has always exemplified like perfectionism in this competition. Bianca, Bob, Sasha, girls who really just personify that fierce New York grit, but also just talent out the wazoo. You know, towards the end of my season I was really turning out challenges, but on the runway just letting myself and y'all down a lot. So coming back to All Stars, I was like, I want to show Ru and Michelle that I can wear nice clothes! So that was my main goal, but also really do well in the challenges as well, so the expectations I had for myself was to really go above and beyond what I did on my season, you know? Just knowing that you guys are seeing that Monet is that bitch! - Now beyond this competition, what do you see Monet X Change doing? What's on the horizon? - After this, I go to Australia and then I'm traveling my one-woman show, "Call Me By Monet." - "Call Me By Monet?" - [Monet] Yeah, "Call Me By Monet." - I love that, that's brilliant! Is there a peach in your one-woman show? - Oh Ru, you know I had to do it. - Oh yes. (all laughing) - Get your tickets. I'mma get y'all complimentary. Y'all gonna come? - Drink tickets included? - Only for y'all, nobody else okay. - Well, Monet, you are a fabulous queen. I'm so glad you got to come back and show the world what you are made of, and you did just that. - Thank you, Ru.

I feel really strong, really powerful, and I feel like a (bleep) winner, girl. - [Judge] I'm quite frond of this. (judges laughing) - Wakanda forever. Final question. Why should you be inducted into the Drag Race Hall of Fame? Monet? - "RuPaul's Drag Race" was one of the first shows that I found on television that I saw myself. To be in this moment in front of y'all, on this stage, I know that some kid is sneaking into his mother's room when she's not home, and watching this show, and seeing themselves in me, and discovering that they have that person inside of them. I do believe that everything does happen for a reason. I dunno who, if it's a God, if it's a sea slug, whoever it is, I do feel like I'm supposed to be here at this time, and show you guys that I do listen and I do take in what you are telling me to to perfect my drag, and to take it to the next level. And I'm just (bleep) grateful. - (bleep) grateful. (Monet laughs) Monet, Trinity. There's only one thing standing between you and the Drag Race Hall of Fame. Two top All Stars stand before me. Ladies, this is your last chance to impress me, and to prove to the world you belong in the Drag Race Hall of Fame.

up! - [Alyssa] My name is Alyssa Edwards and I am 32 years of age. I'm known as the Vanessa Williams of drag because after winning the title of Mrs. Gay America, the crown was taken away from me. Girl, I am gagging. I am here to show people I still got it. I need to get up in this gig, girl. Let me get a look. - [Ru] Deeper. Don't be so shallow, Alyssa. Your legs look like calamari when you do that. - Okay. - [Ru] Dance underwater. Is that dress wash and wear? Careful on these wet, slippery surfaces. Queen down. - At least I did it gracefully. - [Photographer] Very. - [Ru] Alyssa Edwards. Wow. - [Judge] She's all about the drama. - [Ru] It's very drama filled. - [Judge] The bird flew a coop on this one. (laughter) - [Alyssa] I'm serving dark and twisted Alyssa Edwards realness. My blood is flowing and my heart is pumping and my mind is in it to win it. - [Judge] Somebody took the black swan and mated it with the matador and now we've got bird flu. (laughter) (upbeat music) - My train girl, my train. - [Jinkx] Our challenge this week is to lip sync to a past scene from Un-tucked. - Where do you want me to be? - Mimi, over here then. - [Jinkx] My team had to do scenes from season three. It's Shangela, Mimi Imfurst, and Maria. - [Mimi] Boo, just cause you got a sugar daddy who pays for everything for you. - Bitch! (shouting) - [Jinkx] Okay, ready? - Boo, just cause you got a sugar daddy who pays for everything for you. - Bitch! (shouting) - Oh my gosh, watch out, watch out, watch out. Anybody got hurt? - [Alyssa] Graceful. Do it again, come on, press play. Bitch! (shouting) Do it again, do it again. - [Drag Queen] Can I have just one second to get this back on? - Just get it for her fast. Ready, five, four. - Oh (beep). - [Alyssa] Do it again, just roll it up. - I will never look like that. - True. Do it again. - [Drag Queen] It is easier for you to say do it again. Okay, can I have a second? - Oh, but you wanna really fight? - [Ru] Alyssa Edwards. (barking) I think she's choking her dog. - [Alyssa] I have my clutch in my left hand and my baby chinchilla in my right and I'm serving Rodeo Drive fish-ness. - [Judge] She walks like a dressage horse. (laughter) - [Ru] Welcome ladies. Let's take a look at your viral videos. First up, team Serena Cha Cha. In the interior illusion's lounge, Shangela and Maria confronted Mimi Imfurst. - You told them you could do glamor and you were high fashion. Do you feel that you delivered that today? That's the question. - No, but I don't think that was a challenge. - Don't tip toe around the answer. The thing is, you just told us that what you do is camp. - You'll never be glamor. - Boo, just cause you got a sugar daddy who pays for everything for you. - [Alyssa] I've never had a sugar daddy. If I wanted a sugar daddy, yes I probably could go out and get one because I am what? Sickening bitch! (shouting) Stretch and extend all the way over, stretch that side. Today's main challenge is we have to tell Ru Paul's story through the art of dance. This is a very important challenge to me because I own and operate a dance studio. Good and straighten and fingers crossed that everything just falls into place. Oh here we go, here we go, they're coming. One, two, three, four, second five, down, seven, up eight, back one, two, three, four. - [Roxxxy] The looks on their faces were like uh oh. - Oh, that's real fancy, girls. And I about (beep) my pants. - Bye kids. - Bye guys. - Sike and it worked. (upbeat music) - Hi. - [Travis] How are you guys? - Good. - [Nick] Are you guys ready to dance today? - [Travis] All right, so let's start with scene number one. - [Nick] Oh, good Ru, evil Ru, this one's gonna be good. - [Alyssa] After not speaking to Co Co for two years and then blow up last week and then being picked for his team today, I'm hoping that our chemistry can be there and we can really deliver. - I think you should definitely do the lift. This is about trusting each other. Can you just take her around this way and turn me and go, lift, like that way? Slide and jump, go. (laughter) I feel like they're like hesitant 'cause they're just not willing to trust each other yet. They definitely have the most work cut out for them. You'd run around her, you'd grab her by the throat and then you just let her go. Go around, go around, go around, go around and then grab him by the throat, grab. Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake. - It felt so good. (upbeat music) - [Alaska] Alyssa's most known for her faces that she makes in the mirror. - [Alyssa] The weird faces, that's my favorite part. - [Alaska] Playing the ugliest face game? - [Alyssa] Yeah. - [Drag Queen] So that's what you do on the runway, Alyssa? (shouting) (whimsical music) - Just pull it all in. - [Ru] Act Two of No Ru-Paul-ogies starring team Co Co Montrese. I can't wait to see how this turns out. (intense music) Super stardom was so close, I could taste it, but there was a war raging, a battle between me and myself. I hit rock bottom. I had two choices, to die, or die trying. (intense music) (applause) Bravo. Alyssa Edwards. - Tonight is ridonculous and I've not seen a queen grand jete across the stage before. Fierce. - [Judge] You embodied everything of the evil Ru and I don't think the evil Ru lost. - No, it didn't lose. - [Travis] If you walk into every challenge as confident as you were with this challenge, I think you'll go a very long way in this competition. - [Ru] The winner of this week's main challenge is Alyssa Edwards. - [Alyssa] I'm at a loss for words and that doesn't happen much. I'm just very thankful. - First up wearing pink, Alyssa Edwards. Who are the jewels by? - They're rented. - [Ru] The night of the opera. Jade Jolie. (laughter) Thank you Jade Jolie. Jinkx Monsoon. Oh my. - The missing Olsen twin. - [Ru] Uh huh. - [Judge] She just woke up. - [Ru] This way Jinkx. - [Alyssa] I don't think Jinkx did anything with the blanket, she just put the blanket on and gave it a character, what she does best. - All right Ian, so who wore it best? - [Ian] It is a stiff competition I will say, but it has to be Alyssa Edwards. - [Ru] All right, Alyssa Edwards. Alyssa Edwards. The little mermaid's all grown up. - [Alyssa] I am the definition of fishy glamor. Always and forever, Alyssa Edwards. - [Judge] What's her net worth? (laughter) - [Ru] She has a date with Moby Dick. - [Judge] Lucky. - [Ru] Now, in my illustrious career, I've had to put on my makeup without a mirror or during a power blackout. So for today's mini challenge, you have to apply your makeup in total darkness. (laughter) Lights out. (laughter) - [Alaska] I'm certain that whether it's light or dark, Alyssa is still making this face in the mirror. - [Ru] Ladies, I'm watching you. Hm, interesting. Very interesting. All right, lights up. Alyssa Edwards. It's kinda gorgeous. (laughter) Alyssa, we're still here, hun, over here. - [Judge] Alyssa Edwards. Action. - Every woman has a secret. Mine happens to be a little bigger. - What did you say? (laughter) - My secret? I'm a man. (laughter) - [Ru] Alyssa Edwards. Dallas meets Dynasty meets Not Landing. - [Alyssa] I am giving 2013 business woman and I am living for my gig today. - [Judge] Ah, the smell of it. - [Ru] Ah yes. - [Judge] Does this skirt make my damask look big? - For today's mini challenge, we're going to play the crying game. - Oh no. - [Ru] Where you need to cry on cue. Tears. So put on some mascara and meet me in the sharing circle. - [Alyssa] Being an Orange County housewife, it's not as glamorous as it seems. My husband, he was addicted to sex. - [Ru] There's nothing more sad than the tears of a drag queen. - [Alyssa] I gave that man everything I had. - Ladies, thanks again for sharing. The two winners of today's mini challenge are Detox and Alyssa. Congratulations. - All right. My name is Alyssa Edwards and I need, I need, I need, I need, I need to get up in this all star gig. (laughter) Baby, I am Alyssa Edwards representing season five and I was a lovely fifth alternate. Thank the Lords above, I'm back, back, back, back, back again. Alyssa Edwards realness. 'Cause I'm what? Sickening. Back rolls? Oh, she has got her Russian get up on. - I love that you're wearing a cape again. - You know, I didn't know if I wanted to be Goldilocks or Little Red. - Red Riding Ho. - [Drag Queen] Alyssa Edwards, she looks just like she did when she walked in season five. Just with a little better hair and slightly less rolls. - Girl, look at us. - Get up in the mirror, girl. - This is really good picture, okay, okay. - You cannot have a conversation with Alyssa if you are in proximity to a mirror and even if like Ed McMan had risen from the dead, presenting her with a three hundred thousand dollar check, she'd be like. One second, one second. It's nice to see that they re-grouted the brick and no, I was not talking about you that time. - Oh, she already started, girl. The shade is knee deep already, girl, day one. Allow me to introduce to you Monsters Inc. (laughter) Alaska gutted. Foxy Andrews rotted. Co Co Montrese, beast. (laughter) - [Ru] Up next, Alyssa Edwards. Talent, variety. Alyssa Edwards, welcome back. - That's right Mama Ru, I'm back, just minus the back rolls. - [Ru] Now I have a feeling that we are one step closer to finding Alyssa's secret. Let the music play. - [Narrator] Long, long ago, there was a little gay boy from Texas. - Mesquite, Texas darling. Baby, hand me that script and let me tell the real story. I packed a bag, hopped on a plane, and Ru Paul declared, Alyssa Edwards, a star is born.

(applause) Condragulations. Welcome back ladies. Two top all stars stand before me. Ladies, this is your chance to impress me, win 10 thousand dollars, and earn the power to give one of the bottom queens the chop.

Oh, I see why you love me darling. - [Judge] That is amazing. Kodak mammories. (laughter) - [Ru] Alaska, with great power comes great responsibility. Which queen have you chosen to get the chop? - [Alaska] As it gets fewer and fewer, it gets more and more difficult and so I hope that this queen who I consider to be my sister will understand the decision that I've made tonight. So the queen I've selected is Alyssa Edwards. (sobbing) I'm so sorry. (sobbing) - [Ru] Alyssa Edwards, as it is written, so it shall be done. You are an all star, always and forever. - Thank you. - Now, sashay away. - I'm so sorry, I love you so much. - Well, I was a lovely fifth alternate. (laughter) Always and forever, Alyssa Edwards. (laughter) I'm gonna take my own advice. Winning isn't everything, but wanting to is. There are so many people that wanna be in this competition and I'm one of the lucky ones. A true champion isn't the one that necessarily leaves with a trophy. (sirens blaring) Alyssa, it ain't over. (shouting) - I'm back, back, back, back, back again. - Hello, hello, hello. (cheering) Welcome back strangers. It's time for the returning queens to get their revenge and I can't wait to see who gets the last laugh. - Oh God. - [Ru] Because for this week's all star maxi challenge, you'll be doing a stand up comedy show in pairs. The top two returning queens will lip sync for 10 thousand dollars and the power to give one of the bottom queens the chop. But most importantly, get the right to return to the competition. Hashtag revenge of the queens. - [Alaska] The last time we were paired together, you ended up being in the bottom and going home. I don't know who sent you home, whoever did, I will never forgive them. - No girl. Even though Alaska chose me to leave the competition. - Alyssa Edwards. - I still have so much mad respect for her and I feel like the respect is mutual between us. - [Alaska] Okay, I think we need to play to your strengths. - Yes. - Your strengths are off the cuff buffoonery responses, like you're, yes exactly. - Let's do it. - [Alaska] For this challenge, I really want Alyssa to have the freedom to go off on Alyssa Edwardian tangents 'cause that's when she's really funny and that's when she succeeds. - You make an outline, I can go with it on the fly. Now I might have my cliff notes. - [Alaska] Cliffs notes. Like the person's name is Cliff. - [Alyssa] Who told you that? - I read them, they're books. - Yes, exactly. (laughter) - My name is Alaska, just like the state. - My name is Alyssa Edwards and this definitely ain't nobody's secret that this gig-arama is completely full of buffoonery, rigor-y, and straight up tom foolery. (laughter) - Totally. (laughter) Alyssa, we're in the company of some amazing queens tonight. - Where? (laughter) - Ouch. Detox and Tatiana are here. - [Alyssa] The hills have eyes part two the remix. (laughter) - Bam. (laughter) Describe Michelle Visage in one word, go. - Beast! (laughter) - Burn.

Tatiana, you're a winner baby and Alyssa Edwards, you are also a winner baby. (cheering) Condragulations, you are both back in the competition. (cheering) I'm giving you each a tip of five thousand dollars. What you doing, girl? - Um, I'm marketing executive opulence fashion tape. - Oh, that's fabulous. What do you think I got going on over here? - It looks like you've got Alyssa's go go juice. (laughter) - [Alyssa] It's a shot of G-3, the go, go, go. - Oh. - [Alyssa] When people think of Alyssa Edwards, they think of high energy. It don't have to be a Tuesday or a Saturday, full speed, full throttle, full out. - I mean, I guess I'll try it. My name is Alyssa Edwards and this is the true secret. (mumbling) - [Maria] Alyssa, and action. - Why wake up and just be cute when you could spring up and be drop dead gorgeous? - [Maria] Um, what you just did wasn't really full of energy. If you're selling an energy drink, you gotta be energetic. - Okay. - [Judge] Oh yes, oh, oh. Oh, the phone's ringing, the phone's ringing. Oh, someone's calling. To the camera, to the camera. - Pick up your step. Yes, yes. And kick, and layout. Yes, woo, woo! - Come on Debbie Allen. - Right. - [Alyssa] My fellow Americans, now I know you've all been dying to know my secret and I'm here to share with you the latest energy enhancer, DDG, Drop Dead Gorgeous. That puts the go in go go. So if you're looking to refuel your life and get a nice good kick and a boost, why wake up and just be cute, when you could spring up and be drop dead gorgeous? Not only am I a consumer, I'm also the president. - Let's give a big drag race family welcome to Alyssa's sister, Tabitha. (cheering) - I'm very close to my sister, Tabby. I'm so happy to see her here. When's the last time we seen each other? Oh, mom's funeral. - Yeah, a year ago, you know that's tomorrow it makes a year. - Yeah. But at the same time, there's so many mixed emotions. Mom would have loved to do this, she would have. - Yeah. I'm glad we're together 'cause it's a sensitive time for us. - Well thank you for coming. The day that they closed my mother's casket, I just shut down. I just threw myself into my work. I felt that if I didn't see my family or if I shut them out, I didn't have to face the passing of my mother, so now seeing Tabitha, oh, I'm facing it. - It's just a piece of me will never be, I'll never be complete. - And I felt like there was so much on me, that's why I just said I have to, I have to focus on work, keep myself moving. - Keep yourself busy. - That's why I've been traveling so much. - Yeah. - I needed time. It was too much for me. It was too much. I'm feeling guilty because I just don't think that I've been a good big brother because I should've been there more for my family. It's just kind of something that I'm holding heavy on my heart. As much as I wanna be in this challenge to win, it's hard to get my head in the game. It's like I'm at capacity. - Alyssa Edwards, you've brought Tabitha here. - This is my baby sister. - [Ru] Now, you don't seem like someone who's that flashy. - Right. - Where do you think this one has gotten the Alyssa flare? - Our mom, that's where it came from. - Really? - Yeah. - [Alyssa] She had a personality that was just, it lit up a room. - [Tabitha] Yeah, energetic. - My mom danced, I got that from her. She felt like everything I touched was gold. - [Tabitha] She was always encouraging. - [Alyssa] I had one person that believed in me, like she protected me from the cruelty of the world. - [Tabitha] You are what you are because of her. - Yeah. - What was your mom's name? - Cheri Ann. - What does it say here? - Um, love never dies, but someday we all will. Tomorrow's the one year anniversary of our mom's passing. - [Ru] So is this a dedication to her? - Yes. - [Ru] And have you processed all of this yet? - I don't, I feel like I. - No. - Taken, it was like taking the time to sit down and like face it a little. It was the right time. - [Ru] I'm glad you guys get to be together because I think this needed to happen. This is for Cheri Ann. - Yeah. - The world gets to see her fabulousness through you. She's with us. - She is, definitely. - Thank you so much. - Thank you. - I'm putting you in full drag today. - I can't wait to see this side by side. - [Alyssa] I think when I get in drag, I see, in me, I see so much of you guys. - [Tabitha] Yeah, and we all have mom's eyes. - [Alyssa] Yeah, the big eyes. - Yeah, beautiful. - [Alyssa] Today's the day, it's the one year anniversary of our mom's passing and I'm like okay, just be strong, be strong, be strong, Tabby, we're gonna do this. I don't wanna be so sad today. - No, we need to be happy and show out for her. - We're gonna show out for her. - [Ru] Serving glamor, family style, Alyssa and Ava Edwards. Oh my goodness. - [Judge] They're all out of Aqua Net at the store. - [Alyssa] Oh baby, so much hair on the runway. Mrs. Tabitha, AKA, Ava Edwards is all up in the gig. - [Ru] Oh honey, don't mess with Texas. Detox, with great power comes great responsibility. Which queen have you chosen to get the chop? - [Detox] On one hand, you have Alaska, who has been slaying this entire competition and then you have Alyssa who has also been slaying and then you have my best friend, who I feel like there have been several times when she didn't necessarily deserve to be in the bottom and tonight especially was one of them. Unfortunately, I do have to make a decision. I chose Alyssa, I'm sorry, I can't send him home. I'm so sorry, but I just couldn't send Roxy home tonight because she's been so amazing and I just couldn't do it. I'm so sorry. - Don't be sorry. I love you so much and I just hate this. - [Ru] As it is written, so it shall be done. Alyssa Edwards, you are an all star. Now, sashay away. - Thank you. Thank you guys, good luck you all. Well now was as lovely, fourth runner up. (laughter) I'm not angry, I'm not upset. Today was so magical. I had the opportunity working with my sister and I did everything that I wanted to do. I can't leave this competition with nothing other than a sense of joy, so I'm very proud. Aw. Don't cry. Why are you upset? - Because you're always a winner to me. - That's all that matters. - And they did what anybody else would have done, they eliminated their biggest competition. - Oh, was I the biggest one? Give me a high five. That's my sister right there. (laughter) I'm leaving this a better Alyssa than I came in, that's the win. I am Alyssa Edwards, always and forever. (upbeat music) - Oh girl. - NY in the house. - My name is Bob The Drag Queen and I'm 29 years old. My drag is funny, it's irreverent, what you see is what you get. My bodysuit says it all. You're welcome. (screaming) - Yes, take it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. - I'm hilarious, beautiful, talented and humble. How are you? No just one more. (screaming) Take it. (laughing) - That was too real. - New York, New York and New York, yeah girl. - Oh. - Maybe some of the other Queens are like resentful that there's so much New York City representation. There's a reason New York City has some of the best drag queens in the world, and that is a fact. This is a gag. - The children don't even know. - [RuPaul] Next, Bob The Drag Queen. - Hey stop, stop - You got two more left. - I'll just look shocked. And how about we do like that black and white photo where no one - Nice. - [RuPaul] Thank you. Bob The Drag Queen gone with the window. - [Judge] Yes honey lead with the bag, I love it. - [Bob The Drag Queen] This outfit shows I have the ability to make a finished garment. The fabric is hideous, but the construction is everything. - [RuPaul] No shade, but that dress looks like it was made out of curtains. - [Ross] Frankly my dear, I don't give a dental damn. - Team Naomi, my co-director Faith Evans is here. - Hi ladies. - Now she has lived this life. So if you have any questions for her in terms of character or inspiration. - What's the best hand to slap a hoe with? Like the left or the right? - Well I'm left handed. - [RuPaul] All right so places people, places. - Action. - Now where the hell is Rocious? Rocious. - Rocious probably smelled you and went running. - Well then why did I waste my time putting on this? (laughing) Why you all gagging? I bring it to you every episode. - Cut. - You say this is an overacting challenge. I'm like, you ain't gotta tell me twice. - [RuPaul] Bob The Drag Queen. Not to be confused with Bob the high school counselor. - I didn't have enough time to finish the transformers outfit. So I do my backup plan. I'm like a Tron robot inspired character. - She's a robot oh yes girl. - Be careful. - And I'm just like trying to move on stage without breaking a limb. - [RuPaul] Nice save. She's like a robot. - Okay slow down girl. - Whoa, whoa, whoa. (upbeat music) - Girls at this damn white party, we're gonna act like a family. - Hey, Hey, Hey. Hey. Hey. I know y'all ain't starting this white ass party without me. And why it gotta be white? You know. Where's Rocious. Rocious. - Rocious probably smelled you and went running. - Oh. Well then why did I waste my time putting on this. Oh there's more, yes. Yes. Why'd I waste my time doing that bitch. - Bob The Drag Queen, condragulations you're the winner of this week's challenge. - Thank you. Oh wow. Now the other girls can see what I can do. I feel like everyone knows I'm a girl to beat. - Welcome to Snatch Game. Let's meet our supermodel contestants. Vogue cover girl, Chanel Iman. Hey. - And Sports Illustrated bombshell, Gigi Hadid. - Hi Ru. - Hi darling. - I'm so excited. - [RuPaul] Are you ready to meet our stars? - Yes. - We are. - From orange is the new black, Uzo Aduba is here. - Don't say nothing stupid, don't say nothing stupid. How you doing RuPaul? - Are you ready to play the game? - I'm excited. I don't know why you all gagging, she bring it to you every season. Snatch Game. - First question, Gigi Hadid. There's a new dating app for drag queens. When you join the first question they ask is how big is your blank? Let's go to Gigi Hadid. - How big is your wig? - I love that. - Let's go to our superstars and find out if you got any matches. - Okay. - [RuPaul] Crazy eyes. - Because you pretty, I just wrote a poem to Iman. A once a queen named Iman, remind me of the sun instead of her supermodel life, she can be my wife. - Unfortunately Chanel that is not a match. Next question. Let's go to Gigi Hadid. Lady Butney has an unusual way of celebrating gay pride. Instead of the rainbow flag, she hangs her blank out the window. - Her tucking panties. - Well look who's here. - I'm sorry that I'm late but Uzo Abooboo left the stage and she asked me if I would fill in. - Ladies and gentlemen Carol Channing. - Oh thank you. (laughing) - All right Chanel Iman, Sally the supermodel is so lactose intolerant, when the photographer says cheese, she blanks. - Sneezes. - She sneezes. - I've worked with Sally for so long. She pops a pill RuPaul. She pops a pill. - There is so much talk about drugs. I haven't taken anything but lipitor for the past 10 years. You don't really get a buzz off of that. - Now is there an anal option? - I might happen to have a flea or two in my home. - A flee in a month, now you're talking my language. - If you stay ready, you ain't got to get ready. By the way Eartha I didn't know that was you down there. - It's me darling. - From here I couldn't tell if you were Della Reese or Luther Vandross, I couldn't see, these aren't even my good glasses. But back to the matter at hand, I just wrote corn. - Yeah it's always a good answer. - You know there's no dairy and it comes out the way you put it in RuPaul. - [RuPaul] Bob The Drag Queen. - Oh. - [RuPaul] Not to be confused with Bob the camp counselor. - [Gigi] I love. - My favorite Madonna look is Madonna at the Glad Awards and she's dressed like a boy scout and it is a huge political statement. And I'm not in a kimono. - [Judge] Get a load of those girl scout cookies. - [RuPaul] And she earned a badge for walking children in nature. Welcome ladies, Bob The Drag Queen condragulations you are the winner of this week's challenge. - Thank you, thank you. Woo! I took a risk and it paid off. It is a known fact that Derrick Barry is not very smart. When she heard Britney Spears, she said, does she? I prefer fencing. It is very hard to have an intelligent conversation with Derrick Barry. The only thing harder is Robbie Turner's wig lines. (laughing) Robbie Turn, Turn. I know you're a huge fan of classic movies and television, may I recommend one of my favorite classic TV shows, 'Flipper'. (laughing) - Ladies, since you love reading so much, I want to share with you my favorite book of all time, 'The Wonderful Wizard Of Oz.' This week's maxi challenge is your chance to strut your stuff down the yellow brick road, but you won't be doing it alone. Please welcome some drag race super fans. - Oh my God. - The cast of Lifetime TV's 'Little Women LA'. - So how do you fit into your group? Because here's the thing, they're sick of me winning all the time, so they're all like, oh Bob wins everything, everyone loves Bob. - In the first season of the show there was a photoshoot that we did and the photographer were giving me all of his attention. Terra- - Which one's Terra? - The bitchy one. - The one right here? - Yeah. She was really bitter so I know how you feel. - I mean I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a little nervous. I don't know if there's anyone in 'The Wizard Of Oz' more the opposite of who I am than Glenda The Good witch. And I think honestly a lot of the girls wanna see me do bad. I am nervous. - Why? - You know you guys are all (beep) gunning for me to lose. - Well of course we are, we just want you to trip and fall that's all. - Our resources are very limited. - You know in like Master Chef competition they always give each other mustard and honey. - Oh bro this aint Master Chef honey. They hate me, they're not gonna give me their stuff. These hoes are evil. - [RuPaul] Serving Glenda The Good Witch couture is Bob The Drag Queen and Rob The Faux Queen, Glenda Evangelista. - I'm really shocked that I dressed as bad as I did, but we looked good. Me and Rob The Faux Queen are like living our dreams on the runaway. - I think I wore that outfit to prom. - I think I wore that outfit to prom. - I want to try to create you as like a super villain. So I want shots of you in the video, like doing this. For today's challenge, we have to come up with a presidential campaign ad that promotes ourselves, but at the same time smears the opponent. I want to clear up on this idea that you're not smart and that I'm really smart. - I'm down for that. I want ours to be the best. But we both wanna win and that's the kind of energy we need right now. - Why should Bob The Drag Queen be president? Because I'm louder than everyone else. - Shh. - I'm the loudest one. - Shut up Bob. (laughing) - Alright Bob, your turn baby. - Can I get like the big couch over here. I'm going for a little bit of Michelle Obama meets Hillary Clinton. So like Blackie Onassis. - Here we go, action. - I believe in strong drag family values. Derrick Barry only had one baby for breakfast. - That was great. - So now we have to do the Derrick's stuff right. - Yeah, there's a scene in the end where she eats the baby. Oh, that's good. That's like Norman Bates (beep) - Okay good ready? Action. - Why? - Derrick is going in. - Go with it, go with it. (laughing) Great cut. - That was awesome. - I'm really shocked. Derrick has never let go like this. - Fabulous. - We did it. - Are you really doing an all white face? - Yes, someone to finally stand up for white people. - Bob you're quite a political person if you will. - I like getting into politics, it's actually fun. My slogan is actually my real life slogan. Bob The Drag Queen, a queen for the people. I live my life by this. I was in Albany in the Capital Building when marriage equality passed. In 2010, me and a couple of my friends decided to get together and do something about the inequalities we experience in the gay community, and we decided to do something called 'Drag Queen Weddings For Equality'. And we'd do these demonstrations in Times Square every single Saturday until there's marriage equality in New York state. And I got arrested at Bryant Park for blocking traffic. They (beep) threw my ass in jail in full drag girl. Like you don't have to go get arrested, but just something. Something as simple as voting. It is really important because politicians they literally make very real and very, very important decisions for you. - Like you could have done maybe something about it before it happened. - Oh you can definitely do something about it. - [RuPaul] First up here's Bob The Drag Queen. - Bob The Joker. - Uh Oh. - I've decided to do a look inspired by the movie 'Freaks'. So I look creepy, I look gorgeous. I'm serving girl. - [RuPaul] Harlequin, romance, novel. - [Judge] Oh and the sneer, I like that. - First up Bob The Drag Queen. Let's take a look at your shady political ad. - Hi, I'm Bob The Drag Queen, a queen for the people. And as a public servant, I believe in serving the people. That's why I want BJ's for every single American. That's right, better jobs for every American. Buy yourself something pretty. I believe in strong drag family values. I adopted these three needy drag babies and Derrick Barry only had one baby, for breakfast. Bob The Drag Queen has a plan, the gay agenda and it's designed by lesbians, so you know it works. Bob The Drag Queen for president. Why? Because I didn't eat a (beep) baby. This ad was paid for by uncle Steve. He got money girl. (laughing) - I love that you threw so much shade that you made your opponent look like an absolute maniac. You did an excellent job, strong shape. - You have a very small amount of time to tell your story, to get the laugh and I think it was tight and it worked. - You demonstrated gravitas. - I'm gonna throw a challenge at you. I would love to see a fully realized glamoursaurus rex. - Okay. - Bob The Drag Queen and Derrick Barry, condragulations, you are both the winners of this week's challenge. - Congrats baby. Pleasure meeting all of you. - Thank you all of you. - I'm glad that we wanted together. Working with Derrick I've learned to like and respect him. - Let the bitch fest begin. - Coming to the stage, Kim Chi. - I used to be 350 pounds. - And what did you get down to? - 349. - Oh my God congratulations girl. - But the camera adds 10 pounds, I ate like seven cameras. - Do you have a bit of a speech impediment? - Speech impediment. - Oh my God Kim this is ridiculous. Bye Kim. - Oh (beep). - Well hello there Bob. - Hey RuPaul. - Now last week the judges, Michelle specifically, called you out to see if you could do glamazon drag. - I'm gonna glamorous for my book look. So I'm taking this corset, I've already got three pieces glued down, look at me and go. Do a corset that kind of branches out, goes past the bosoms, then I'm gonna do like a gradient color. - Is that a conscious decision? - It's a consciousness. Cause if you come to one of my shows, it's like me on stage by myself for an hour and a half. And if I'm going to be in like a gown with huge earrings and a big old sculpted updo, by the time my show is done, my eyebrows become my mustache. I'm sweating. See what I mean. So I'm gonna show up in a leotard. - You're so confident. What scares you? - My mom got sick recently. She has like a chronic and really rare form of pneumonia called BOOP which sounds cute, but it's not that cute actually. I got the scariest call which is like you need to come here. I was like really freaked out. - Yeah, yeah. - My mom has been very physically fit and then she was just like skinny and frail and like her hair was falling out and she couldn't do anything, like anything. - Wow. - I mean it was really hard to see my mom like that. All of the things in my life that, that make me a good person are because my mom taught me to do it. I don't have a lot of people like my mom in my family. (beep) got me bitch. - Wow that's pretty rough. What'd you think your mom would think about you in this competition? - My mom thinks I'm the best ever. My mom is the funniest person right now. My mom was my hero. She showed me that you can do anything, more importantly come through anything. - All right. Well I wanna see gorgeous Bob The Drag Queen. - Note taken. - All right, thanks. - Here we go girl. - [RuPaul] Up next we've got Bob The Baby Drag Queen. Why that's the biggest pearl necklace I've ever seen. - [Bob The Drag Queen] When I was just a little boy I asked my mother what will I be? Am I going to be pretty? Am I going to be rich? And here's what she said to me. You'll be a drag queen bitch. - [RuPaul] She's working at Pebble Flintstone's Couture Bob The Drag Queen - [Bob The Drag Queen] Martha Caldwell. She can make a power suit from New York and Company look like Saks Fifth Avenue. She also sacrificed. When we would go and get a happy meal, she would give me her adult size fries and drink and that's what moms do. - [RuPaul] Viola Davis. "Why is your penis on a dead girl's phone?" Bob The Drag Queen. Not to be confused with Bob the librarian. - [Bob The Drag Queen] It's not about being the prettiest or wearing the best dress, it's about taking huge risks, learning from your mistakes and taking advice from people who've done it already. Look I may make waves, I may rock the boat, but dammit we're gonna make it to shore. - [Judge] Hope you like short stories. - She has a spastic semi colon. - Is that what that is? Bob The Drag Queen, Derrick Barry, I'm sorry my dears but you're both up for elimination. - I'm not mad. I'm like you're right, I get it. But I'm a little disappointed in myself. It's not a fun feeling. - Two queens stand before me. Ladies this is your last chance to impress me and save yourself from elimination. The time has come for you to lip sync for your life. Good luck and don't (beep) it up. ♪ Floor darlin' and I feel like I need some more ♪ ♪ And I feel your body close to mine ♪ ♪ And I come make me feel ♪ ♪ Mighty real ♪ ♪ Make me feel ♪ ♪ Mighty real ♪ ♪ You make me feel ♪ ♪ Mighty real ♪ ♪ You make me feel ♪ ♪ Mighty real ♪ ♪ When we get home darlin' ♪ ♪ And it's nice and dark ♪ ♪ And I know you'll love me ♪ ♪ Like you should ♪ ♪ Oh you make me feel ♪ ♪ Mighty real ♪ ♪ I feel real ♪ ♪ Real, real ♪ ♪ I feel real ♪ ♪ I feel real, real ♪ ♪ You make me feel ♪ ♪ Mighty real ♪ ♪ Oh you make me feel ♪ ♪ Mighty real ♪ ♪ I feel real when you touch me ♪ ♪ I feel real when you want me ♪ (cheering) Ladies I've made my decision. Bob The Drag Queen, shantay you stay. - Thank you. I just want to say, I probably had the biggest blood of the season with Derrick Barry and I ended up being her biggest cheerleader. Even if you're afraid of something she does it harder than anyone. I love her. And I guess that was the lesson that we learned today. (laughing) - You may join the other girls. - So brave. - What do each of you think you've learned about yourself throughout the competition. - I've learnt that apparently I can come off as very arrogant, but I attribute it to confidence. I have not always been this confident. I was like a little chunky kid. I was really a effeminate, really dark skin and kids can be mean to you. So once I found out what I was good at and I really embraced it, people started to like me. Find something about you that you like and focus on that. If I don't like my face, if I don't like my skin if I don't like my weight, I think to myself I have nice teeth and it may just start with one tooth. Look at that tooth, that's a nice tooth man. And then once you can accept that little thing about yourself, you can just accept you for who you are. - But first Bob The Drag Queen, not to be confused with Bob the barista, no foam. - [Bob The Drag Queen] This is it. This is the final runway. So I wanted to wear a tuxedo and do a feminine version of it. So I'm wearing this crazy sequin jacket. This is quintessential Bob The Drag Queen. - [RuPaul] Tell me about it stud. - [Bob The Drag Queen] Resit peachy, pass it on. - Ladies here at RuPaul's drag race we have the luxury of celebrating who we are but we must never forget that even today, there are little boys and girls who feel they don't fit in. So I want you to turn back time and share the wisdom you have today with the child you were then. So Bob The Drag Queen, this is you- - That is me. - At four years old. - Yeah. - What do you have to say to little Christopher? - I say hey girl. I would tell myself, you're gonna want to change for others, do not do that. I just wanted to be like my brother or like my uncles. I was so different than every other guy in my family and I just wanted to blend in and be like them. But once I realized that how important it really is to be me, then I really shone through. And I would also say, don't take out that student loan freshman year of college, just pay out of pocket like you did the rest of it because it's still haunting me to this day. - Thank you Bob. All right ladies, final question. Why should you and not your competitors be crowned America's Next Drag Superstar? Bob The Drag Queen. - I have statistically done the best in this competition and you reward the person who's done the best with the highest reward. I don't just do what I do for me, I literally do it for anyone who can come within the range of my obnoxious raspy voice. I serve the people. I serve the community and more than just doing stand-up comedy, and actually getting my hands and feet into the dirt of the community and helping it grow, because the community has helped me grow and it's made me who I am today. - Thank you. Ladies before I can decide who makes it to the top three, that's just one more thing. This is your last chance to impress me and save yourself from elimination. The time has come for you to lip sync for your life. Good luck.

Now our top three queens have snatched your attention all season long and tonight I've challenged each of them to slay the stage one last time. Purse first, a New York city girl who puts the taint in entertaintment, give it up for a demure little lady we call Bob The Drag Queen. (cheering) (audience cheering) (audience cheering) - Now Bob, you excelled at so many of the challenges. Did you study the show before you came on? - No I'm just really talented. (audience laughing) Listen this is my favorite show. This is what I thought I was supposed to be doing my whole life. When I was performing in like bars in New York city, dodging beer bottles, literally, I was like this doesn't feel right, there's something bigger coming. Lo and behold, I found something bigger, her name was RuPaul and she blessed me. (cheering) - Now Bob, at one point in the season, the other queens were rooting for you to fail. What did that feel like. - It felt like I was doing it right. I mean no one's rooting for the person doing the worst. No one was like, oh you're doing bad you should get out, they're like, oh she's doing so well, get her the (beep) out of here. (audience laughing) - All right so we've got some fan questions over there. - Hallelu I'm back RuPaul. (cheering) Tucker from Florida wants to know, does your humor come from overcoming a dark place in your life? - See I have the struggles that a lot of y'all homosexuals here had- - What there wait, wait. There this? (cheering) - A few. I had the same hardships that everyone else here has and we all deal with it in different ways. If you find something to filter your pain and your anger into it'll flourish, it really will. - Thank you Shantay. Now Bob, you blew everyone away with your Snatch Game impersonations. Now did you ever hear from Uzo or Carol Channing? - Well Uzo tweeted at me and was like, but this was amazing. And I was like thank you. And I am obsessed with Carol Channing but she's just, she's 95 it's hard to get out of the house when you're 95. I'm 18 and it's hard for me to get outside. - Yeah I know, I know. Well we did hear from the one and only Carol Channing. Take a look. - Thank you Bob for your colorful impersonation of me. I'm so honored to be a part of your history. Oh, I'm proud of that. (cheering) - Oh my God. - Yes. So Bob I know your brother's over there, right? - Yeah he's the one who was just a shade darker than me. I'm 11 o'clock, he's midnight. - Justin what was it like growing up with Bob? - Bob used to cry on my birthdays because it wasn't about him. - It's true. - Now Bob I know that your mother couldn't be here because of her health. - Yes. - Darn you know it would have been a great opportunity for us to have a taped message or something but we don't have, wait a minute. Oh actually we do have a taped message. - Oh. - Let's roll that. - Bob this is your mother. I'm very proud of you. I've always believed in you even when you didn't believe in yourself. Continue to work on your craft. Always respect your fans. Reach or the stars Chris, do the best you can. Like I always tell you and your brother, keep the first thing the first thing. And I love you. (cheering) - You got me, you got me. Oh my goodness. - Now Bob, what would it mean to you to win $100,000? - Winning $100,000 isn't the thing because money comes and goes, but winning this title, that means something. You get to go forth and carry a legacy and do something and make a change in somebody's life and put first things first and do something. - Right. (cheering) - Now I've watched all 109 episodes of RuPaul's Drag Race and I have noticed you have never once walked into the room purse first. - Oh my God, look at this. Oh and it matches my outfit. It's perfect. I love it. Purse first. (cheering) Give it up for Bob The Drag Queen. As always I've consulted with the judges and the fans, but the final decision is mine to make. The winner of RuPaul's Drag Race, America's next drag superstar is Bob The Drag Queen. (audience cheering) (upbeat music) My queen, is there anything you have to say? - Yes, I have too much to say, but I'm gonna keep it to one thing. Take whatever you love about yourself and walk into the world purse first. (audience cheering)(dramatic music) - Mother Monster has arrived. - Wait a second. (suspenseful music) (queens screaming) (upbeat music) - Holy (bleep) balls, it's Lady Gaga. Like, the real one.

Jujubee's Journey And I'm Still Here. - Jujubee's Journey And I'm Still Here. - My target audience from my book is gay Asians. When you're a gay Asian male, they don't see you as that. They see you as a woman who was born into the wrong body. That's definitely not me. It basically starts out with my childhood, the discovery of my homosexuality. - Wait a minute, hold up. - I know right? - Your homosexuality? - I know girl. And then I touch on, you know like the loss of my father and then my move across America. - How do you say fierce in Laotian? - I would just say Juju. - Juju. - Juju-ah - [Photographer] Hello. - Hi. - What's the idea for the book cover? - I just wanna look good. - Whatever you want. - Let's try to work this (beep) up.

I have sense of style and I have great big white teeth. - Why are you better than the other girls? - I just got finished writing a memoir and I call it Memoirs Of A Gay-Sha. - Where do you hide your candy? - There's a lot of candy going on down here, it's not true with this about Asians honey. - Jujubee let's take a look at your book cover. - Memoirs Of A Gay-sha, Jujube's Journey I'm Still Here. I just want to show people that you can go through things. Take that negative energy, turn it around and use it to live. It's a lesson. - Love the title. - It reminds us of a great book already. So that was very clever thinking. - There's a lot of candy going on down here, it's not true what they say about Asians honey. - By the way I know a number of big Hollywood moguls who would like to take you out if you're ever available. - It looks older than I wanna look. No. Let's see if we could get an attractive shaped one of these? It would make my face look a little thinner. - [Jujubee] I think bigger hair would make your face a little thinner though. - But didn't you see those though on me? It was just like. - No but you have to...just trust me. I've been doing drag too long to know that a flat wig is going to help out a big face. - Because what I was thinking, if we could-- - [Jujubee] Were you not listening to me mom. - No. - Just shhh. - How's it going out with your new mommy? - It's Contessa Touche. - Contessa Touche. Wow. I love that. What do you have planned for your drag mother's outfit? - She wants to just look really elegant and she doesn't want to look too old. - Or too fat. - Really the only challenging thing with Contessa at the moment is her confidence level. - All right, carry on. - All right mama. Uh ah, look more attitude. To the hip. The time has come for us to do the runway and rehearse honey, we only have 20 minutes. Hold your head up high miss honey, and then right up here we're going to stop, flirt, kind of rub yourself a little bit like this. Right. Pretend you're Celine Dion. Do you feel sexy? Confidence.

We have to come up with a lot of jokes and then perform them while doing celebrity impersonations. The pressure is on. I'm going to do B Arthur. Do you know who you're going to do? - I think it'd be a really funny Nicki Minaj. You doubt it. - I kind of do. - Well who would you see? - You need to do one of your voices. - I can do a Fran Drescher. She's funny. - She's funny, but are you going to be funny doing her? You come up with this one. - I'm trying to, I can't do it. Girl I'm a funny bitch but I don't write no jokes. - What is a joke we could say about Alexis or Yara? - You know what we can do? Well Lexis looks like the predator and Yara looks like she's wearing poodles on her head. - (beep) - Writing jokes is not easy. - No. - At all. Okay. Now I'm worried. - Raven, Jujubee. - Hi mama. - Who are you going to be? - B Arthur. - Now why'd you pick B Arthur? - I think she is brilliant. - And she could land a punchline. - Yeah. - Even just with a look. - Yeah. - What about you Juju? - I decided on Fran Drescher. - Let me hear you do Fran Drescher. (giggling) - Very good. Now are you afraid that you won't be able to translate your natural humor into this challenge? - A little. But we've been coming up with some stuff that we find very funny. - Would you try one on me? - Hey B what's the difference between Pandora box and a clown? - Clowns wear more makeup and they're more entertaining. - Oh, are you done? - Oh, did Ru just clock us? - Well, you know it's early. He wasn't in character voice. Listen, I'm going to let you get to work 'cause you got your work cut out for you. - Yes. - All right get to work. - Yes. Bye. - What do you get when you cross Raven and Latrice Royale? - Brown chicken, brown cow. (giggling) - I heard Manila's a supermodel now. - Well she must model for the left because she isn't right.

These ladies are having a Tupperware party and your invited. - [RuPaul] Rujubee. - Jujubee. You don't really look anything like Fran Drescher. - I don't? - But you really nailed the laugh and you really nailed the humor. - I think your look tonight is really great. You do look like you're going to chase the Beatles down the street. - I was at that Beatles concert in 1965 and I think that's what I was wearing. - [Jujubee] This challenge isn't about points baby, it's about personality. Oh girl I got this. - All right bitch let's go. I want you to persuade people to loan you $5. - Can I borrow $5? - [Raven] Oh, not him. - Can I borrow $5. - Well it depends, what do I get for it? - I'll give you a kiss on the cheek. - Okay. - Ooh. - We have seven minutes. - Let me see I don't have five bucks. - He doesn't have $5. - Tell him he can put a foam hand on his hand and slap you in the face with it. - Will you put this on. - All right. - Now smack me with it. Smack me with it. - Oh thank you. - Oh okay. - [Raven] We have four minutes get someone to moonwalk with you. - Will you Moonwalk with me? - Moonwalk? - Yeah. - Okay oh, Oh, Oh, Oh. - Three minutes left. - Okay tell him to hit it. - Girl. Really. - The next guy that walks by, I want you to try and get him to spray whipped cream down his pants. Grabbed him. - Do you mind if I sprayed whipped cream down your pants? - We have one minute and 30 seconds. - Can I spray whipped cream down your pants? - Sure. - Just Come here, baby. - Oh my gosh. - What? - Okay go bitch, down it. Down. There you go. - Can I have a dollar? - I actually don't have a dollar - 15 seconds.

Who would mess with this nasty bitch? - Raven and Jujubee. I'm sorry, my dears but you are up for elimination. - Raven is my dear friend and I do not want to lip sync against him. But at the same time, I don't want to go home. - Two Queens stand before me. Ladies this is your last chance to impress me to save yourselves from elimination. The time has come for you to lip sync for your life. - I didn't know I would have to lip sync against you Ju, but I'm going to fight for my spot to stay in this competition. - Good luck and don't (beep) up. ♪ Somebody said you got a new friend ♪ ♪ Does she love you better than I can? ♪ ♪ I'm in the corner ♪ ♪ Watching you kiss her ♪ ♪ Oh oh oh ♪ ♪ I'm right over here ♪ ♪ Why can't you see me? ♪ ♪ Oh oh oh ♪ ♪ I'm giving it my all ♪ ♪ But I'm not the guy you're taking home ♪ ♪ Ooh ooh ooh ♪ ♪ I keep dancing on my own ♪ ♪ I keep dancing on my own ♪ ♪ I'm just gonna dance all night ♪ ♪ Stilettos on broken bottles ♪ ♪ I'm spinning around in circles ♪ ♪ I'm in the corner ♪ ♪ Watching you kiss her ♪ ♪ Oh oh oh ♪ ♪ I'm giving it my all ♪ ♪ But I'm not the guy you're taking home ♪ ♪ Ooh ooh ooh ♪ ♪ I keep dancing on my own ♪ ♪ I keep dancing on my own ♪ (sobbing) - I can't breathe. - Raven would you help her?

Shannel and Chad will you please step forward? - I love you guys so much. - My top four all stars, for next week's final challenge, no more teams. It's every queen for herself. - Hi Cheri. - Hi Juju. - It's time for my lesson with Cheri Oteri and I can't believe that I'm in the same room as this legendary comedian. - Let's see it. - Okay. So my parents immigrated from Laos to America in 1976, they swam here. I'm just kidding, I'm just kidding. - If you're going to make a joke, commit to it. - Okay. Let me start by telling you about my government name. It's Airline. - Well wait, is that really your name? Airline? - It is. - What were they thinking? - Baby I think that was the only word they saw when they came to America. - Okay that is funny, I think you should say that. I love when people talk about their family. - Okay. The funniest thing about my name is that my grandmother could never, ever get it right. - That's great. But what did she wear. - Okay. - You know and what did she walk like? And you can exaggerate - Okay. Stand up is so hard. I can be funny just being me, but forcing funny is not easy. - You know, you're really funny if your family never talks to you again. - Give a warm Hollywood welcome to Jujubee. (applause) - I'm so nervous right now. It's the final challenge. Anybody could win. Hopefully it's me. (applause) So first things first, right. I was born a drag queen and the afterbirth was glitter. When I came out, I had a Mac lip glass in one hand, the other one was a jazz hand. Everybody do a jazz hand with me darling. Woo. So basically I pop out and they named me Airline. I mean my parents must've been on some good shit. The funniest part about my name really is that my grandma can't say it. Picture this okay. Old Asian lady, titties down to here. Alin, Alin I come home and all I see, wigs, undy wear panty, blue Paul CD I don't know what is going on with you. Are you gay. Well kind of. Alin look in my face, you fucking liar. You go out with boy. You know, I feel really confident. I hope that crown is nice and heavy and shiny. - [RuPaul] Jujubee. Touch this skin honey. - [Jujubee] I'm serving you up some fierce, sexy, sultry diva. - [Judge] Oh it looks like a blue moon tonight. - [Judge 2] She must live in Asbury Park. - I am Jujube from season two of 'RuPaul's Drag Race' and season one of 'All Stars'. Third time's the charm. - Oh. - Come on grandma Barbie. - I have never been blown like that in my life. - Miss Jujubee you give good mouth. - (beep) you. I made it to top three, twice. It is time to take the crown. What about Jujubee? Give me the crown RuPaul. Can I have the crown? Please. Okay I am so dressed for all your funerals 'cause I'm going to kill you all. Get ready baby. - You've aged so well. - Oh like cheese. This Jujubee has stepped her pussy up. This is like I am the pussy staircase. You know what's kind of funny it's like if we were ink in a printer, it like it runs out by the time we get to (speaker drowned). - Mariah Paris Balenciaga. Great you're here so we have to change the name to 'RuPaul's Drag Race 'Some Stars'. Mayhem Filler. Farvey, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I mean Meh-ham Miller (laughing) Alexis Mateo. I don't want to be shady so I'm not going to bring up your weight, but when you work, do they pay you in pounds? (laughing) - Bitch. - [RuPaul] Jujubee, the shade.

She's a little slutty, but she's still a good girl so she's not on the naughty list. - Oh my goodness that's Jujubee, the Beaster bunny. - [Jujubee] The truth is I really love Thanksgiving, but I was not going to come in dressed like a Pilgrim because of cultural appropriation. I do not want a Pilgrim to be upset with me. - A queen for all seasons. Jujubee condragulations you are the top All-star the week. - Thank you. I've been waiting a really long time to win something. Thank you. You want a carrot? - You've won a seven nights stay for two in the penthouse suite at The Grand Resort And Spa in Fort Lauderdale Florida. Hi Jujubee. - Hi mama. - You're making something here. Do you sew? - No. I've done it before. - So here we are in the Charles' family backyard ball. - Yes. - I know that there was some backstory with your family that your mother had left the family. - Yeah I was 15 and dad died so it was me, my two sisters and six months afterwards she kind of had a meltdown and left with some man and I was me and my two sisters we became basically wards of the state. I was very lucky I got to live with my aunt but my two sisters were put into foster homes. - Really? - Yeah. - Oh my goodness and how long were they in there? - We disconnected for, for about five years and then got back together. - So how have you created family in your adult life? - I've had to let go of a lot of the people in my past because it wasn't healthy for me. So most of my friends now are my friends that I meet at my meetings because we share the same spirituality, we're all broken inside. - Oh yeah. - But we're working on becoming better human being. A couple of years ago I made some decisions that would affect my life. I broke up with my fiance of 12 years and I also made a conscious decision to stop using drugs and drinking. And that has been very impactful for me not only as a human being, but as a drag queen. I'm not completely found, but I'm not as lost as I used be. If that makes any sense to you. - Oh that sounds like a gospel song. I want to hear Albertina Walker sing that song. And you stick with those friends in those places that you and I both know about because I think what you're going to find is they will help you. 'Cause I wouldn't be here today without those friends. I wouldn't be here. - It's a beautiful moment for me because I needed this meeting. I needed this and I'm so happy that there's somebody here that I can relate to with this. And it just so happens to be the person that I look up to the most. - It's a real, real gift. - Thank you. - And you can honor that gift by shining and sewing and cooking. - I'll bring the potato salad. - Is that your signature dish? - With raisins and MSG? - You can leave out the MSG. - No my campaign is Jujubee for MSG. Vote for me. - Okay yeah, okay yeah. Well, got my vote. I'm gonna let you get to work. It looks like you got a piece of fabric here that you have not cut, you have not patterned, you have not done a damn thing to. - I folded it in half. - You folded it in half. So I'm gonna let you get to it. - Thank you, mama. - Thank you so much. I'll see you out there. - Yes ma'am. - [RuPaul] Jujubee. - [Jujubee] Sorry I'm late, I didn't wanna come. I'm RuPaul's Asian bestie 'cause once you go Asian, that's all you be craving. My name is Ping, but everybody in my family calls me Amber. I hope you like my outfit. For the backyard fish fry, I brought my famous potato salad with raisins, which I made with potatoes and raisins and my secret ingredient, MSG. Today I'm planning on spilling a family secret. RuPaul isn't just my bestie, she's my psychological mommy dearest. Bye. She has had it. - [RuPaul] Jujubee. - [Judge] Look at the melons on her. - [Judge 2] Now do you spit or swallow? The seeds, the seeds guys. - [Jujubee] Ooh girl I am giving you the only Lappy Tappy Ms. Tappy, USA mama. I'm wearing watermelon's, my favorite fruit. My hair is just absolutely perfect and coiffed, nobody's touching this. I'm the watermelon lady. - [Judge] You've got appeal. (upbeat music) (Katya speaks in foreign language) - [Contestant] Oh. Is this Russia? - With love. My name is Yekaterina Petrovna Zamolodchikova, but you can call me Katya. - [Contestant] Come on, accent. - And I'm just your average run of the mill Russian bisexual transvestite hooker. Is this the Schulman bar mitzvah? (speaks in foreign language) Hi! Katya is at the intersection of glamor and comedy. And you can find her right on the corner, selling her ass. - Is this Soviet Union inspired? - It's actually my great grandma's army uniform. (group laughs) I am terrified for this elimination. We have to be naked, and I have the body of a 55-year-old Irish rock climber. Give me a (beep) break. - [RuPaul] Now, sissy that walk. Up first is Russia's own, Katya. - [Judges] Ooh. - [Kathy] Katya awesome. - [Katya] It is my dream to walk down the main stage runway of RuPaul's Drag Race, and I have to do it naked. I rip off the thing. - [Judges] Oh! - And I'm giving you Russian red hippy realness. I think they're buying it. When in doubt, show them your (beep). I don't know. - [Kathy] Oh! - [RuPaul] Oh, dear. - She dropped something. What an ass. - Thank you. - No, her. - Oh. - Does her fringe match the drapes? (judges laugh) Ladies, this is your last chance to impress me and save yourself from elimination. The time has come for you to lip sync for your life! - I'm about to perform a song by Olivia Newton John right in front of her, and I am sweating like a hooker in church. - Good luck, and don't (beep) it up.

I'm gonna (beep) murder that next challenge, whatever it is. (group laughs) - Ladies, it's time to release your inner golden girl. Katya, I love the smell of Bengay in the morning. Katya, Emerald City fashion week. (judges laugh) - [Judges] Oh! - [Katya] I am in love with my look. I'm sissying that leg. I feel confident. I feel sexy. I feel stupid. - Yes, honey.

(judges laugh) - For today's mini challenge, you'll be making your own paper versions of classic celebrity red carpet outfits. Mrs. Kasha Davis and Katya, Bjork. - [Contestant] Uh-oh. - Next up, recreating the infamous swan dress. Katya, and is that Joan Rivers? - What are you wearing? (group laughs) - Actually, I'm wearing a custom-made Klein Epstein & Parker suit. - Stunning. And this next gal, she's wearing a swan on her body and an elephant on her ankles. (group laughs) (Katya mumbles) Now available on iTunes. - Bjork flew all the way from Iceland for this, and boy, are her arms tired. Good job, ladies. I've graded your papers and the winning pair is Mrs. Kasha Davis and Katya. (group cheers) For this week's maxi challenge, you'll be acting in the behind the scenes reenactment series, #RuHollywoodStories. (group laughs) This week's episode, Whatever Happened to Merle Ginsberg? Y'all remember Merle? She sat by my side for the first two seasons of RuPaul's Drag Race. I could almost see her now, so soft, so wise, so blurry. (group laughs) - Goodbye, Merle? But I'm not going anywhere. Ru and I are great friends. - Well, I'm her best friend, okay? And I'm supposed to be a judge here. You got it, Merley girl? (laughs) - Ginger is gonna be the evil villain, which is perfect because she's playing it like Ginger Minj as Danny DeVito, as Tony Soprano, as the Fonz, as Michelle Visage. - Hey, Merle, how's my cake? Don't you want sprinkles? - So I have to find a way to kind of not get overshadowed by Ginger. - [RuPaul] Now, sissy that walk. Katya. - [Merle] Something seems really fishy here. - [RuPaul] I think we're gonna need a bigger boat. - [Katya] I'm summoning up my best Tara Reid in Sharknado. I've got the stringy blonde hair and I'm feeling the Shark Week fantasy. - [Ross] They both have fabulous mouths, don't you think? - [RuPaul] Yes. - [Merle] And they both unhinge at the jaw. - [RuPaul] Whatever happened to Merle Ginsberg? - I'm Merle Ginsberg, and this is my story. I was at the craft service table, getting my morning martini and I spotted RuPaul and said, "Hey, Russi-q. "I'm so glad to be back for season three." And RuPaul said, "Oh, Merley girl, "I could never do the show without you." - You have job security for the rest of your life! - Ah. - Little did I know that we were not alone. (Ginger coughs) - Oh my god, you scared me. I didn't see you there. - Not very observant for a judge, bitch. (gasps) Ru! I brought you a cake! - All of the brothers would wanna eat this cake. Speaking of, I need to say hey to the new pit crew. - Goodbye, Merle? But I'm not going anywhere. Ru and I are great friends! - Ginger Minj, yours is the winning team. - Yeah! - You are all safe. But tonight, on the runway, one of you stole the show. Katya, condragulations. You're the winner of this week's challenge. You'll receive a $2,000 gift card from Fabric Planet. - Yes! I won a challenge! I am so excited! Bodily fluids spraying out of every orifice. It's down to eight girls. My game plan going forward is to kill a few of the girls to make it to the top. - Snatch game! (group cheers) Now go on and hashtag that! - Snatch game is the challenge that every fan of RuPaul's Drag Race has been waiting for. We put on these giant latex frog costumes and we go through a fiery obstacle course. Okay, all right, I'm sorry. You compete on a live game show, a parody of the Match Game. - Hello, Katya. - Hi. - [RuPaul] Who are you doing? - Suze Orman. - Have you done her before? - Nope. - Now, I know that you do a Russian act-- - Yeah. - Because the Katya character is a Russian. Why didn't you do a Russian character? Because you do it so well. What is it you're afraid of? - I don't know. I think it's like my whole life, I've been riddled with anxiety, fearful of things that aren't a big deal. - Ah. - I'm afraid to show this character because it's the thing that I do best and I'm terrified of failing at it. - You have an addiction to the anxiety. - I've never thought of that before. I've been addicted to alcohol, crystal meth, cocaine. - The reason you're here is because you're super talented, so don't be afraid. - Okay. Addicted to anxiety. - Next up, financial advisor, Suze Orman. - Hello, my darling dear little chickadee RuPaul. - Now, Suze, I make $8 an hour hosting this show. Can I afford a yacht? - Ah, how about a little rubber ducky? I'll throw in a hot bag of nickels just in case. - You've got a deal! - Now, in this new version, Dorothy blanks the Tin Man. - Well, of course, she bangs him, which is exactly what I'd like to do to most of these women here on this panel. (RuPaul laughs) Except for this one down here, Miss Donatella. She looks like a skeleton made out of beef jerky. This morning, I'm second guessing myself about my performance in this challenge. I don't know where I stand in the eyes of the judges. All I can hear is the voices in my head telling me how terrible I am. (sighs) Can I talk to you for a moment? - [Miss Fame] I'd love to talk with you. - [Katya] Okay. - [Miss Fame] What's going on? - I, I am like kind of freaking out. I've been completely sober for the past year and a half. Most of the time, I'm fine. But being away from my network of support has been brutal. I know that Fame is sober, so she's the only other person who can understand exactly what I'm going through. How long have you been sober for? - I've been sober for nine years, but counting days in here feels like being a newcomer. - That's exactly what it feels like. Like, it's hard. - Mm-hmm. I've never seen that of you. - I'm pretty good at hiding it. I am terrified of failure. - [Miss Fame] Yeah. - And like, my sense of humor is just like, has been like a smokescreen for that. - Yeah. - I have to tell you, the first day I came in here, the first thing I thought of was like, "You don't belong here. "You're not good enough." I didn't realize like how badly, I've actually never been able to love myself. It's like... - It's okay, boo-boo. You are loved. You are loved. - In this competition, I'm having to like deal with all the insecurities that I don't wanna face, and I did not expect that. - You're being so hard on yourself. You're in it, but you're not alone. I'm here with you having those same fears and feelings. - This moment is what I needed. - I needed it too. - Thank you so, I love you. - All right, my name is Miss (beep) and I'm an alcoholic. (Katya laughs) Truth be told. - My name is Yekaterina Petrovna Zamolodchikova and I'm a drug addict and alcoholic, oh! After my talk with Fame, I feel like a weight has been lifted. - [RuPaul] Katya, oh! Samantha Fox is such a wild dame. - I'm trying to just serve sexy and confident whore, slutty cougar on the prowl, third rate Faith Hill impersonator, 80% sexy, 20% disgusting. - [Female Judge] Look out, Tawny Kitaen. We got a new white snake, bitch. (RuPaul laughs) - Now, for today's mini challenge, you'll be serving some bitch rich reality realness. Using clear plastic tape, you need to nip and tuck your mugs to plastic perfection. You'll be shooting a title sequence for my latest series, the Fake Housewives of RuPaul's Drag Race. (group laughs) - Katya seems to have built an entire forehead out of tape. She is serving Herman Munster realness. - What's the best part about being married to a sociopath? The constant threat of danger keeps you so thin. (RuPaul laughs) Do you know how to tango? - No. - Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jamie Lee Curtis. - It's like Spanish. - Violet and I are paired up for the first time, and I'm not exactly sure how this is gonna go. - [RuPaul] Katya. She comes from a drag house divided. - [Female Judge] Meet me halfway. - On one side, I'm giving you flamenco flapper. My feminine side is very coy and demure. And then bam! It's a man. - [Carson] I think this one's gonna be a split decision. - [RuPaul] Oh, yeah. - [Carson] Oh. - [Female Judge] Nice. - [RuPaul] Now sissy that walk. - [Announcer] Doing the tango vogue, it's Violet Chachki and Katya. (upbeat tango music) (upbeat dance music) (upbeat tango music) (upbeat dance music) (upbeat tango music) - Next up, Katya. - First, I wanna say that I loved seeing you with this black hair, 'cause I know we're used to seeing Katya in red hair and blonde hair. We haven't really gotten the black fantasy yet, I don't think. - Ooh, girl. - Well, I've had the black fantasy many a time, but not from you, Katya. - When I saw you come out on the runway, I was like, oh. Like you were very coquettish. And then when you turned, and I mean, this as a compliment, it was very like hot douchey guy. - That is amazing. - Katya and Violet, condragulations, you're the winner of this week's challenge. - Oh, my god! I'm so (beep) happy. Oh, you (beep) bitch. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - [RuPaul] Hello, Katya. - [Carson] She's Putin her money where her mouth is. - [RuPaul] She sure is. - [Katya] (speaks in foreign language) My name Hello Katya, and I'm from the magic land of Siberia, and everyone loves my bad breath. One extra special thing to know about me is that I'm the sweatiest woman in showbusiness. I feel like my socialist side will balance out Hello Kitty's decadent capitalism. That's why Hello Kitty and I will be best comrades forever. - [RuPaul] She's not Russian. She's taking her time. - [Rebecca] She is. (upbeat music) - (speaks in foreign language) My name is Yekaterina Petrovna Zamolodchikova but you can call me Katya. (snorts) You may remember me as the lovable Russian hooker from season seven with a crippling anxiety problem. But I'm back with a refillable prescription for Xanax. - [RuPaul] Yowza, Babraham Lincoln. - Pass me the (beep) baby oil, bitch. (RuPaul laughs) - You did a beautiful obscenity. - When do I get to blow them? I can't say that? (speaks in foreign language) (snorts) During my season, I feel like I held back out of fear. Whenever anything went wrong, I wanted to jump off the hotel balcony. But this time around, I wanna just spread my legs even wider. (speaks in foreign language) Coco Montrese, I always wanted to know what the female gremlin would look like in 25 years. (group laughs) - [Contestant] That was a good one, bitch. - Ginger Minj, in my eyes, the true winner of season seven of TLC's I Didn't Know I Was Pregnant. (group laugs) Roxxxy Andrews, I think about you all the time, especially in the morning at the bus stop. (group laughs) Too soon, too soon, sorry. - [RuPaul] Up next, Katya. Talent, gymnastics. (group cheers) - This bitch is over here on her hands, pussy poppin'. All right, Miss Katya. You get the gold from me. (group cheers) - [Contestant] Who are you doing? - I'm gonna do Bjork. - Oh, right. - All-star Snatch Game gives the chance for those who bombed in their season to really stand out. - The totally wacky and original Bjork is here. - I love your suit. - Thank you. - It reminds me of the lining of my small intestine. (group laughs) - All right, Jujubee, are you ready for your question? - Mm-hmm. - My play cousin Cornesha is such a party animal! When mosquitoes bite her, they have to go to blank. Okay, Jujubee. - The clinic. - Yes! Good answer. - Right. - Let's move on down to Bjork. - I'm pretty excited 'cause I also said clinic. - [RuPaul] You said clinic! - Yeah. How many bones do I win? - How many bones do you want? Oh. (RuPaul laughs) See you after the show, bubbles. (RuPaul laughs) Oh. - [RuPaul] Did you hear that Bjork? - I'm down for anything, especially I'd like the eat her hair. It looks like pastrami. (RuPaul laughs) - Something else looks like pastrami too. - (gurgles) Oh. (grunts) Brrt. (RuPaul laughs) - [RuPaul] Up next, Katya She's into water sports. - Oh, it's Esther Williams, Fister Williams. (RuPaul laughs) - [RuPaul] Wow, look at those breaststrokes. - [Ross] Our cycles are synchronized. - [Katya] I'm giving you a skin-tight sea foam green Esther Williams underwater fantasy. My waist is cinched. My nose is pinched. And my body is absolutely drenched in sweat. - [Ross] Her look is making me wet. - [RuPaul] Take a dip in the cool waters of Katya. (judges laugh) Up next, Katya. - I love this runway look so much. I like when people do something that's what you're not expecting. And what you gave us was like this Esther Williams moment with the full cap, and then you have like the nose thing, which is the genius little touch that I expect from Katya, so right on. - Thanks. - Snatch Game, I loved the Snatch Game. When I think of Bjork, I think of like an Icelandic toddler on LSD, and you gave me that. - You're just brilliant. You're an artist. And all of your answers were just so psychotic and I just love everything that you do. - Whether people knew who Bjork was or not, we all understood exactly what you were doing. And that's what makes a really good characterization. It was fabulous. - Thank you so much. (judges laugh) - I've made some decisions. Katya, Alaska, you are the top two all-stars of the week. Katya. Ooh, Barbara Eden. - [Carson] I dream of weenie. - [Nicole] Ooh, there she goes. - [Group] Oh. - Thank you. (judges laugh) - [Katya] I'm giving you full health Sharon Tate fantasy. It's Rosemary's babushka and I feel amazing. - Not tonight, Satan. Not tonight. Katya and Detox starring in Velma and Weezy. When last we saw Velma and Weezy, they were taking a shortcut to the bottom of the Grand Canyon. They may be dead, but they're still best friends. - Where is she? Velma, what took you so long? I think I'm having a nervous breakdown! - The Quickie Mart didn't sell brain, so I ate the clerk's brain instead. - Ah. - Oh, and I robbed the store. - We don't need money, Velma! We're zombies. Hold on, I got a great idea. Selfie! Ooh-wee! (knocking on door) - You ordered room service? - No. - Mother (beep). 'Cause suddenly, I'm very hungry. - Hoo-hoo! If it isn't that handsome Brad Pitt lookalike that stole all our money. What are you doing here, BJ? - You come back to give us that money you stole from us, baby, with interest? - Maybe he's just here to see what it's like to get some head from the walkin' dead! Woo-hoo! - Bitch, he's mine! - (gasps) Bitch, this is a street war! - Weezy, you zombie skank! You (beep). (both scream) - I swear to god, I hate you! (both scream) - Look what you did! - Look what you did! Oh! (both scream) - Thanks, ladies. (both gasp) - That sassy son of a bitch took our money again. - No matter what happens, I'm glad I got to be a zombie with you. - I've never felt more dead? Hey, Velma, would you mind if I partake in your little arm here? - If you can't eat your friends, who can you eat? (judges laugh) - Yes. Oh my god, yes! Hey, Katya. - Hello, mother. - We are excited to hear what your product is. - So it's called Katya's Crisis Control, and it's a refreshing body mist. And it also packs the right amount of Thorazine to protect from anxiety, fear, hallucinations, or ghosts. - So you're selling-- - I'm selling a feeling, a sensation of like-- - You know, that's the first way to kill a brand-- - Oh. - Is to sell something that doesn't have value. So I think you have a little bit of a branding identity crisis. - Okay, well, that's very on brand for me. (laughs) - I think right now, the only crisis here is the product. I wanna have something that somebody actually wants to buy. Just lose the bottle and the whole idea. Start over. - Okay. - I'm sorry. Thanks, Katya. - Thank you. Whoo! (laughs) (upbeat muic) - Hi, Katya. - So for today's maxi challenge, we have to pitch a product that reflects our brand. - You've got props. You've got pit crew, and you've got furniture courtesy of our friends at RiverWorks. - Is there a pig? Oh, there's a Turkey, that's even better. (Carson chuckles) I'm gonna hold the turkey. I'm in a kitchen. - You look confused. So you're in the kitchen. - I'm in the kitchen. - Okay, and you're going to be standing there. - Standing here in the kitchen. - [Michelle] What's your lines? - These days, being a woman is really hard. Keep going? - Okay, is there more? - Oh, yeah, yeah. That's the whole commercial. (Michelle laughs) - [Carson] Do the whole thing, do the whole thing. - [RuPaul] Katya. The Russians are taking over the runway. - [Katya] I'm giving you 1980s lesbian literary agent, disinterested, pissed off, Ellen Barkin fantasy. Comrade Katya, to androgyny and beyond. - Up next, Comrade Katya. - Riddled with anxiety? Crippled under the burden of existential pain? (judges laugh) Jello. My name is Katya Zamolodchikova. (judges laugh) You know, these days, being a woman is tough. When I'm not struggling with my weight or worried about wrinkles, I am bombarded by a cacophony of demonic voices in my head telling me, "You're not good enough." (RuPaul laughs) That's why I created Crisis Control, a moisturizing body spray that provides relief while heavy doses of Thorazine shield the psyche from pain. So go ahead, control yourself. (judges laugh) - That is ge-ni-us. Your commercial is brilliant, just very, very funny the whole way through. - You were really working within your whorehouse, I mean wheelhouse. (RuPaul and Katya laugh) Let's talk about this runway look. You looked gorgeous. You really were modeling othe (beep) out of it. (Katya laughs) - The outfit is so wrong, it's right. - Everything you did, your commercial, your product and your look are on brand. - Thank you. - Alaska, Katya, condragulations. You are the two top all-stars of the week. Hello, hello, hello! - [Group] Hi! - Ladies. Now queens, as gay people, we get to choose our families because sometimes, the families we grew up with don't understand us. So when I recently reached out with an invitation to your moms and sisters, I'm sorry to say that not one of them accepted my invitation. They all did. So let's give a big drag race family welcome to Katya's mother, Pat. (Katya screams and laughs) - My mom! I hate that (beep). No, just kidding. How does it feel to be in Hollywood? - Oh my god, I feel like a star. (Pat laughs) - This is it, this is it. It's so different this time like from season seven though because it's like a lot more joyful and less riddled with anxiety, which is a new thing. - [Pat] That's awesome. - Yeah. It's so cool to have my mom in the room now when I'm not a nervous wreck. What I'm thinking is sexy Russian trophy bride with her peasant mom. - And who am I? (Katya laughs) - This is definitely gonna be a transformation. I don't think my mother has ever worn heels in her life. She's used to spending under $10 for a blouse at Savers. I probably shouldn't say that. Oh my god. This fits you like a (beep) glove. That's incredible. - Hey, Katya! - Hi! - Hi, Pat! That lace front looks like it's coming out of your head. - (laughs) It isn't? (Katya and Pat laugh) - Now, did you watch your child on Drag Race? - Yes, I did. - What was the most shocking thing you learned? - When he got really personal about his struggles with anxiety. Parent, that heartache. I mean, I knew it, but to see it so raw, that was a shock to my heart. And thank you for counseling him. You did wonderful. - Oh, that's very kind. Thank you. Now, Katya, you're the only queen left who is not from season five. - I noticed that, yeah. - Do you think that the Rolaskatox girls are, you know-- - Conspiring against me? - Yeah. (laughs) - Picking off the other seasons one by one? I'm the only one in the group who's not from season five, which means that they all have stronger bonds with each other than they do with me, especially Rolaskatox. So if I end up in the bottom, it could be RuPaul's best friend race, which means I go home. (laughs) - [RuPaul] Up next, Katya and Svetlana Borisnova. Ah. ♪ Yodelay-hee-ho ♪ - [RuPaul] Emphasis on the ho. - Mama! (judges laughs) I'm giving '70s Soviet Anna Karenina, and she's giving confused bumbling babushka. (RuPaul laughs) - What they're wearing, would you call it Russian dressing? I think that is it, yeah. Up next, Katya and Svetlana Borisvitna How'd I do with the name? - Terribly. - Yeah. Say it for me. - Borisnova. - And this is Svetlana Boris (sighs). (judges laugh) - I think the vogueing thing was not high up on the scale of things I love to do in life for Katya. - Yeah. - But then you came out here with this storyline, and I was like, "Yes!" - It just completely flipped the switch for me. It felt so Katya. - You're giving us this like vintage Missoni kind of look. It's something that they would wear in Real Housewives of Minsk. (RuPaul laughs) - Yes, exactly. - Really one of the highlights of the evening. - I will say, sidebar, your mother completely stole the show. - Yes! - Your acting, I mean, you deserve a Tony award for that. - Thank you. - Detox, Katya, condragulations. You are the two top all-stars of the week. You and your loved ones have each won a $2,000 gift certificate from Marc Jacobs. - Oh, wow. ♪ You a basic ho ♪ ♪ And it's your time to go ♪ ♪ So bitch, let me show you the door ♪ ♪ Lenin in the streets ♪ ♪ Dostoevsky in the streets ♪ - Oh, I (beep) up that part.

(Michelle laughs) And you know, that's the secret of life is having a balance. - Absolutely. And you know what? This season, it started out so much better, but still, there was a little bit of like-- - The voices? - One thing that I've been coaching myself with is like, I sort of named that voice. I call her Brenda. - Uh-huh. - And I just say, "You know what, Brenda? "Shut the (beep) up." (Michelle laughs) - I love that. - Yeah, so-- - I found that what you do is you develop another voice that sort of counteracts that voice. - Yeah, Carl. - Wait a minute. It's not Hot Carl, is it? (group laughs) - Being excited to talk with Ru is a new sensation for me. Our rapport is fantastic. So this is the moment that I know how far I've come in the competition. - [RuPaul] Gorgeous! - [Michelle] Yay! ♪ Looky here ♪ ♪ Listen up ♪ ♪ I'm the one ♪ ♪ Oh ♪ ♪ I'm the one, one, one ♪ ♪ Oh ♪ ♪ I'm, I'm the one ♪ ♪ Oh ♪ ♪ Yekaterina Petrovna Zamolodchikova ♪ ♪ But your dad just calls me Katya ♪ ♪ I'm the red scare with the long blonde hair ♪ ♪ Always keep 'em coming back for more ♪ ♪ You a basic ass ho and it's your time to go ♪ ♪ So bitch, let me show you the door ♪ ♪ 'Cause it's me who's getting laid ♪ ♪ And I'm always getting paid ♪ ♪ The only high class Russian whore ♪ ♪ I'm a squashing hot mess in a skintight dress ♪ ♪ That's a rash, not a herpes sore ♪ - Ah! ♪ Lenin in the streets ♪ ♪ Dostoevsky in the sheets ♪ ♪ Baby, are you ready for this cold war ♪ ♪ Katya Zamolodchikova ♪ ♪ Wrote you, told you ♪ ♪ Now I, now I rid ya ♪ - [RuPaul] Katya. - [Female Judge] Wow. - [Judges] Ooh. - [RuPaul] Do the bustle.

(judges laugh) - One final question. Why should you and not your fellow all-stars be inducted into the Drag Race hall of fame? Katya. - Charisma, uniqueness, nerve, talent. What do these qualities have in common? I don't know. I'm not a scientist. (judges laugh) I stand here, a charismatic woman of grace and dignity with a unique sense of humor and point of view. In season seven, you let me show the world that I'm good enough. And here, you let me believe it myself, and I can't thank you enough for that. Like they say in Russia, (speaks in foreign language). - What does that mean? - I have a carburetor outside that I just have to do some work on. (group laughs) - Thank you, Katya. - Thank you. (jazzy music) - This isn't Maury Povich! My name is Trixie Mattel, and I'm 24 years old. - Oh my goodness. - Oh, well, here's another comedy queen. She got her overdrawn lips, and clown makeup. She is ready to go. - I'm a hair and makeup artist. So. I think a lot of the queens don't necessarily get where I'm coming from. Drag queens always say paint for the back row. I paint for the check cashing place down the street. The Maxi Challenge this week is to create resort wear that has a tearaway to reveal a nude illusion. I pride myself on utilizing literally none of my natural features, so a challenge where I have to compete with these beautiful, fishy girls with perfect bodies to me is the worst case situation. (sewing machine whirring) So your partner, are you guys like married or? - Yeah. We got married last year. - My boyfriend's family, I went home for Christmas with them and they really liked me, and then they found out about drag and they called him like in a panic, like, "We don't want you with somebody who does this." - Are you for real? - Yeah. They don't like drag. I don't understand why they don't get that it's just me playing a person. His mom said, "Trixie's clown drag "makes me sick to my stomach," is what she told him. - Oh my god. - They were right about one thing. (person laughs) - [RuPaul] Trixie Mattel. - [Ross] She can't play, she doesn't have any balls. - [Trixie] I'm doing Valley girl, she's at the resort, she's playing a little tennis. - [Michelle] Show us your birdie. - [Trixie] Surprise, I kinda look like a doll, so I'm giving you hinges, life in plastic is fantastic. - [Michelle] A living doll. - [Carson] She's like Skipper's sister, Stripper. (judges laugh) - Hello, hello, hello! (all cheering) Condragulations, ladies. For today's Mini Challenge, you need to give face, face, face while the Pit Crew blows you. (dramatic music) (record scratches) With a leafblower! (RuPaul laughs) The two winners of today's Mini Challenge are Ginger Minj, and Trixie Mattel! (all clapping) Condragulations, ladies.

Come on out, kitty girl! (all yelling) - [Queen] Oh my god. - Hi, Trixie! - Hi! I look like I'm gonna trade some girls some soap for some new makeup, girl. (all laughing) - Trixie Mattel, that means you're back in the race, girl. - I'm back, yay! I thought I was fourth episode queen, bye. I thought I was Mimi Imfurst, and now I'm Mimi Imsecondchance. Katya, where do you get your outfits, girl? American Apparently Not? (all laughing) Ginger Minj. Girl, did you ever save Carol Anne from the Poltergeist in the TV? (all laughing) Violet, I don't believe the rumors. I don't believe you took Sharon Needles' crown. I don't believe you're taking this one either. (all laughing) - The winner of today's Mini Challenge is Trixie Mattel! (all cheering) - I'm back. Trixie Mattel has way more up her sleeve. - [RuPaul] Ginger Minj and Trixie Mattel in Eggs.

Masterqueef Theater presents "The Fake Housewives of RuPaul's Drag Race." - How do I sleep at night? (Trixie laughs) Ask your husband. (RuPaul laughs) (intense music) - Oh honey. Woo, that's how I roll. That is such a (bleep) waste. That would've killed if someone was here. (upbeat music) I'm Trixie Mattel, and I am the crownless drag superstar from season seven. I came here to eclipse people with my talent, but also with my hair. There's nobody in here, it's like a Morgan McMichaels meet and greet. I feel like in the real world I've been a real All Star, but on "Drag Race" I was not an All Star. Howdy, y'all. - You went for the comedy gold, but all we got was bronze. - I need to make amends for the fact that I came in here, and just hit the cement and got dragged out like a dead body. Twice. - It's not about falling, it's about getting back up. - [RuPaul] Up next, the musical stylings of Trixie Mattel!

Hi, I'm Trixie Mattel, I'm 27 years old, and I'm from sunny West Hollywood. And some people might say I'm fake, but those people are alcoholics. He's not even that good-looking, I have to go. Hi! - Hi. - Oh my god, you're even cuter in person than you are on TV. - Oh that's very sweet of you. - You kinda have this sexy like Denzel, like Gilbert Gottfried, but like sensual, do you know what I mean? I like my men like I like my coffee. Incapable of loving me back. Bye, Jason. Sorry, Jared. - Jeff, Jeffrey. (Jeffrey laughing) - Oh my god, you are so funny, stop! - Oh, ladies. - Stop, I said stop! You're literally killing me, you're so funny. - I wanna get to know you both a little bit better. (Michelle laughs) - Is this your house? - Jeffrey, Jeffrey, Jeffrey! - This is like the prettiest refurbished like Cheesecake Factory mall kiosk I have ever been to. - [Jeffrey] Thank you very much. - Do you remember when you wore these shirts on "Unreal?" - [Jeffrey] Uh. - I know the stylist. - This is wow, yeah. - Yeah, I've seen every episode of "Unreal." - You don't know Jeffrey like I know Jeffrey! - Hold on, I have to take this. Yeah, I'm here now. No, she's like a weird tourist girl. - Come across as like crazy, though? - Oh. - Like, do I look crazy? - It's just a really strong word. - He's like a five. - I can't handle it right now, I can't handle it. - You're a little different. - Yeah? - I know Trixie is playing a fake bitch, but baby, those facial expressions are real. - No he, no-- (Milk cackling) No, he's like a five, he's like an LA two. - Stop talking to me! What? Oh my god. - If steam could come off a wig, she would have those little lines above her head where the heat is risin', 'cause Miss Thing is hot! That Milky is cuttin' her off. (Shangela giggles) - People call me psycho, but I don't think I'm psychotic. I just think I'm really passionate about finding love. - Yeah. - Wow, the leaves-- - And that's why I'm here. - Me too, Milk. - The leaves in your hair are so fun. I wish you would leave. - Milk is just going way overboard. - It's been great, ladies. It's been an incredible pleasure. (Milk sobbing) - Bye, Gerald. - It's Jeffrey. - Welcome to another day at the office. Aren't you feeling gorgeous? Aren't you feeling technically amazing? - Milk someday wants to have a challenge inspired by her, and I betcha next season they'll be like, "This week on the runway "you'll be crying because you're only safe." (Trixie cackles) - [BeBe] How are you? - [Trixie] I really, really wanna win a challenge. - Right. - I've never even been in the top, so I really hope today it can happen. The first time I was on "Drag Race," I kinda just floated until I got flushed. All people knew about me was that I did not excel at "Drag Race," and didn't win any challenges. And I never had my star moments. This time I have to change that. I don't really like need validation, but to have one good week here would really help the momentum for the rest, you know. - I feel you. - Being safe all the time, you start to feel invisible. In the real world, I'm a Beyonce. But in the "Drag Race" world, I'm just a LaTavia. It doesn't matter on "Drag Race" what you've done in the real world. In these four fake brick walls, you are garbage until proven otherwise. - [RuPaul] Trixie Mattel. - [Michelle] Ooh, look who's here, Ru! - It's Lady Bunny! - Yes! - I'm Lady Bunny passed out on a deck chair in Palm Springs, getting a sunburn, and then boom! (judges gasp) Oh my god, it's a Tatianna, "Same Parts," "Dennis the Menace" fantasy. - Take another little piece of my hair now, baby. (judges laughing) Up next, Trixie Mattel! - Hi guys! - When you came out, I was feeling immediately like if Lady Bunny and Kesha had a baby. - Were you doing Lady Bunny? What was that about? - I thought can Lady Bunny become Naomi Smalls? Turns out, yes. (judges laugh) - In "The Bitchelor," your character was so spot on. It was basically Paris Hilton. - I was very impressed from the second you walked out. You were on the phone, and you weren't paying attention. It was like, oh, we know exactly who you are. And it was everything I wanted. - But I felt like you were getting talked over a little bit. - We were advised to try not to talk over each other. It was kind of like jump roping. I was kind of waiting sometimes for the moment. - I felt you waiting. - However, when you did get those lines in, they were hilarious. - All right, well thanks, Trixie. - Oh my god! I didn't even know this was happening. I'm gonna do like a pensive, rich woman. (RuPaul giggles) - Okay. - Oh my god. There's so much going on. (RuPaul laughs) (upbeat music) The Maxi Challenge is to create a soup that reflects who you are as a drag persona. Last week, I believed I was going home, and this week I love sewing, I love making costumes, and I'm actually really good at branding and selling stuff. So, I'm feeling really good. I wanna win a (bleep) challenge. Is anybody else doing energy? - Well, I'm not doing energy, I'm doing sugar. When I think of myself, I think of sweet. - Aja's making something really sweet, because she's sweet? - Like sweets, like come get your sugar rush type. Like, I want my soup to be a candy soup. - A candy flavored soup? It's not interesting, and doesn't really brand you at all. That's like, crazy. - Work for your sister, please. (sewing machine whirring) Oh mother (bleep)! Here we go. Girl! - Shangela, what'd you do? (queens laughing) Can I help you? - I don't know what I did, but I didn't do right. - Oh, that is wrong. (Shangela laughs) This is an opportunity for me to at least, in a small way, thank her for saving me last week. This is what you're gonna do. Put this on your body. 'Cause if this fits, this could be really cute. - Mama, it ain't gonna fit over my body, though. It doesn't stretch. Go lower, go lower. - It doesn't stretch? - I didn't know the fabric doesn't stretch! - Oh bitch. (Shangela laughs) - Did it fit? - No, bitch! - No. (Shangela laughs) - Happy New Year, everybody. - It's Elimination Day. We're going to present our looks and our soup cans to the judges, and one of us is gonna get canned. Soup can? - [RuPaul] Trixie Mattel. - [Trixie] Open wide, and get a taste of my non-refillable, prescription only, habit-forming, heart-slowing goodness. Just like my soup, I'm inspired by rainbows, little birdies, and the re-emerging dark recesses of a rocky childhood. (RuPaul laughs) Side effects include drowsiness, nausea, depression, suicidal thoughts, or a broken DVR. - Looks like "Children of the Corn" chowder. (judges laughing) Trixie Mattel. A whore by any other name is still a whore. (judges laugh) - [Trixie] O-M-G, girl. Last night I dreamed I was in the front row of Tiffani Amber Thiessen's fashion show, seated between Karen from finance and John Wayne, who's looking better than ever. Then I raced to dinner with Soleil Moon Frye, Betsy Johnson, and Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and all they could talk about was rhinestoning their lady parts. Wow, I love life. - [Michelle] Ru, who needs a horse toe when you can have a camel? (RuPaul laughs) - Up next, Trixie Mattel! - Hi, guys. - All I can say is R-I-P to this challenge, 'cause you murdered it. (Trixie sighs) - The can came out, and you could've been backstage and I would've known that was your can. - This is definitely giving me disco Barbie. I mean, the whole look is so great. - It tells me a story of a country girl who decided I have to fit in at Studio 54, and the best part about it is you made it! - I did. - You know what your body shape is. The arms, the legs, the width. Even the camel toe. It's all good. - There's not enough money in the world for me to put tape on my dick. - You have a dick? (judges laughing) - I think it's in the back somewhere. - I don't know if you got the invite late, or what, but you RSVP-ed, and you showed up today. - The Trixie that I wanted has finally arrived. Yep, yep, yep. - Yes! (RuPaul laughs) - I tell you what, after Adam Lambert last week I always try to smile at Ross the whole time. - It felt like you were over me being there. - Were you bothered when Adam said that you were standoffish? - Well, only 'cause people have told me before that my tone is just so dry that they thought I was angry. - Sometimes Trixalicious, you don't mean to give that off, but it's unintentional. - Well, oh girl, because perception is reality. I might accidentally sometimes come off as standoffish. I mean, Trixie on stage is fun and bubbly, but me in real life, a lot of the times I'm just like a boring white dude who doesn't like hugs. So I get how that can read. It's something I always have wanted to change about myself. Our whole industry is interpersonal communications. If you're not friendly enough, someone thinks you're a jerk. Remember that thing in West Hollywood, Morgan? I got tweets from other "Drag Race" girls saying that I was acting grand. I'm not super social, so a lot of times I'm just saving it for the audience. - [RuPaul] Trixie Mattel. - [Michelle] She clearly likes to be reamed. (judges laugh) ♪ Sex-sex, sex-sexy drag queen ♪ - Welcome, All Stars. Let's begin with a sneak peek of your movie, which has already been banned in 47 countries. (all laughing) - [Announcer] Glamazon Studios presents the most important film of all time. (phone ringing) - I know you're busy, so I'll keep this quick. I'm getting the old gang together, and I want you guys to be my maids. - Oh, hell no! I'm a rocket scientist now. - My bridesmaids, I'm getting married! - [Announcer] Coming this summer, all your favorite award-winning actresses come together in "My Best Squirrelfriend's Dragsmaids Wedding Trip." Trixie Mattel is Sharon Frockavich. - Yeah, that's all you got, ladies. Two big feet and ugly (bleep) shoes! - Here comes the bride. - Poisoning the wig water supply? Big mistake. Huge. (whistle trills) - Ladies, don't move! You are all under arrest. Now put your legs behind your head. - Woo! (all laughing) - You're a dirty cop, and I'm a whistleblower. - Okay honey, launch that rocket. - [Announcer] And when these divas let loose, who knows what drama will happen? - How dare you invite another dancer here? I deserve to be maid of honor. Give me that trophy! - He's dead! - You killed him! - Why does this always happen to me? - [Announcer] But when the church organist cancels. - You gotta be (bleep) kidding me! - [Announcer] Will they make it down the aisle? - This is some "How to Get Away with Murder" (bleep). - I made you a pie. - Quack, quack, quack! - If you stay ready, you ain't got to get ready. - Pow! - Girl, you don't need an organist. You've got us. - We ate Octavia's pie. - Hit it! (queens farting) (judges laughing) - You guys really are the best squirrelfriends. - [Announcer] So if you love the poop scene in "Bridesmaids" but also love highbrow award-winning actresses, then you'll love "My Best Squirrelfriend's Dragsmaids Wedding Trip." Rated PU. - Up next, Trixie Mattel. - What's your favorite book, just off the top of your head? - Oh my god. (all laughing) - This outfit is everything. - And then in the acting challenge, you were so much fun. Because every take, you tried something new. - And that moment when you used the baby's hand to wipe your hair, I died. - You are now pushing yourself out of the Trixie Mattel box, so to speak, and you're making yourself do things that maybe wouldn't be in your comfort zone. But I think you taking those risks is paying off in spades. - Thank you, I think so too. Hi, guys! - Boo. - I'm walking in to the deliberation with the jury, and I'm very confident. I know you thought that this would throne me. (queens laugh) - Trix, how do you feel right now? - I feel good, I feel great, I feel wonderful, I really do. You guys know the first half of the season, I was pretty like, ugh. But then I just got it, it was like oh my god. - How does it change so quickly for you? - When I fell in the bottom for the first time? I sort of emotionally experienced the worst thing that could have happened. So then I was like, well in the next challenge I'm just gonna do whatever I want, and then it worked. Having that break in the middle of the competition where it just all got really bad, it just made me shrug off every piece of anxiety. It's okay to get butterflies in your stomach. You just teach them to fly in perfect formation. - So, out of the top four, is there anybody that you would be really proud to lip sync against that we should choose? - I think Shangela is and was, and will always be an All Star even before she got here. Because she didn't even have a very long run on "Drag Race," and she did the most with it. That's fierce. - Now I have a way more devilish question. - Oh god. - If there was a queen in the top four who you would chop off to make it a top three, who would it be? - I'm kind of torn between Kennedy and BeBe for different reasons. I think many of us have shown so much growth in being off "Drag Race" for a year, five years, two years. BeBe's been off "Drag Race" like 10 years, and I don't think the growth is like, 10 years of growth. And then, like Kennedy's outfit today, for example, on season seven Kennedy's finale runway was like a rainbow dress. That was like light years nicer than the one she wore today. Sometimes I think she just doesn't have full perspective of even her own gifts. - Your brand is very, like, stamped. How can you broaden that with this title? - Ever since season seven, I have done what RuPaul calls stepping your pussy up. I went on tour as a comedian, topped the iTunes charts in folk music in drag, and then I went on to even star in and develop my own television show, and I felt like an All Star before I got here. - Oh, we love you bitch. - Baby, aww! - Thank you guys. (tense music) - Welcome, ladies. Madam Forewoman, has the jury chosen the final two All Stars to lip sync for their legacy? - Yes, Ru. (suspenseful music) - Morgan? You may tell the queens who you, and the jury, have chosen to lip sync for their legacy. (dramatic music) - Well, we tallied up the votes, and the top two All Stars are Kennedy Davenport. (intense music) And Trixie Mattel. - Kennedy, Trixie, the top two All Stars of the season stand before me. Ladies, this is your last chance to impress me, win $100,000, a crown and scepter from Fierce Drag Jewels, and earn your place in the Drag Race Hall of Fame. The time has come (thunder booms) to lip sync for your legacy!

She's going on 60, 40 years in the business. Graduated law school at 20, I don't know how that happened. - It's a miscarriage of justice. (laughing) - I smoked 80 packs of Virginia Slims every day. I'm sorry, that's not funny to me. - Okay, and action. - Those hideous drag queens had it coming, it was a mercy murder. - Cut. - Sorry, I messed that up. - Taking a deep breath, and, action. - If I'm guilty of being anything up in here, it's a being fierce. - And, cut. Roxxxy. - Uh-huh? - Who are you? - I'm Roxxxy Andrews. A ghetto bitch. - Roxxxy's character of Roxxxy is definitely Tamar Braxton. - Where my people at? Where my people at? - Dot com. - Okay ladies, it's time to do musical chairs and change into your next character. Hit the change rooms. (playful music) So here we go.

(spitting) - What did you just call her? - Roxxxy, humor me. Your spit take, was it overly long? Try to get the water out of your mouth so you can get to your line. - Okay. (spitting) What did you just call her? - Spit takes a usually a bit more. (spitting) - Am I still not doing it right? - Tight. (spitting) It seemed a little bit problematic for Roxxxy, the old spit take. I just need you to snort it out. Like (spitting), what did you say? - I didn't know you wanted me to say the line. - You can tell it's really affecting her when Mathu calls her out. The frustration has gotten to the point where you can tell she's mad. - Ladies, guess what? That's a wrap. (suspenseful music) - As the defense attorney, I'd like to submit my briefs. - The state accuses Roxxxy Andrews of deplorable acts of slayin' bitches. - I plead guilty of being devastatingly beautiful. (upbeat music) - Those hideous drag queens had it coming. It was a mercy killing. - The evidence will prove beyond a doubt that the accused is one cold blooded biotch. - Objection! Reading the witness. (upbeat music) - The prosecution would like to submit the murder weapon. A size three stiletto. - Well I wear a size 14. - If the glove don't fit, you must acquit. (upbeat music) - Now ladies, when the Supreme Court legalized same sex marriage, they moved this country boldly forward. But, when it comes to their sense of style, their justices are like, so 18th century. - Yeah. - Oh, pig crew. Now for today's mini challenge, I want you to drag up these basic black robes.

I get nauseous, after my pesto alfredo sauce pasta, what we had for lunch. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. - Monique was doing a great job and she was funny, but then it just lost the story. - So she spunned it and made me throw up on Bobby Z on his Cavaricci jeans. - You're lying. - Because of that whore. - I still don't understand the cake, and how the writing got on the cake, and why the mom, I still don't get it. - In seventh grade do you know that she let the whole varsity and junior varsity team do things to her? - In high school I had the nickname miss Headquarters.
